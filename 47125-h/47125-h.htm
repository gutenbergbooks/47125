<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p>As I pause in my work to pass in review
the events of three thousand years, which I
have tried to narrate in this little book, I
probably anticipate my readers in wondering
at the audacity, not to say presumption, which
moved me to this undertaking. It came about
quite naturally, to be sure, as the result of an
interest awakened many years ago in a nation
which had sent to America such discoverers
as Columbus and Vespucci, such soldiers as
Cortes and Pizarro, De Soto, and Ponce de
Leon. At first I became curious to visit the
scenes of their adventures, then to journey
through the country whence they had come;
and the result has been that I have devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
a portion of my life to a study of both people
and country.</p>

<p>I do not, of course, assume that an interest
in a subject should warrant one in
writing about it, be he never so well equipped
for the purpose; but with me, the seeing
gives birth to a desire to convey to others
the pleasure I feel, or the lesson I may derive,
from the object under contemplation.
Thus, while I never intended more than to
make a few forays into the historic fields of
Spain, when I visited that country ten years
ago, it has eventuated that instead of skirmishing
with the outposts, I have attacked the
very citadel. That I have come off unscathed,
and with spoil of some sort, is self-evident;
but whether it might not have been to my
readers’ profit if I had not done so, is a question
for them to decide. I feel it to be,
indeed, as true to-day as it was a score of
years ago that (in the words of a standard
encyclopædia) “there is no good general history
of Spain!”</p>

<p>Without attempting to extenuate any possible
errors, yet I would call attention to the
fact that it is extremely difficult to clothe in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
picturesque language (and at the same time
be faithful to the verities of history) the details
of a story extending over so vast a
range, and bring that story within the compass
of a single volume.</p>

<p>The best histories are those which treat
of single episodes or periods, such as Prescott’s
Ferdinand and Isabella, Irving’s Conquest of
Spain, Spanish Voyages, and Conquest of
Granada. To these, in truth, I would refer
my young readers for a more extended acquaintance
with Spain and her fascinating
history. In those charming narratives the
dry bones of fact are clothed in graceful
drapery, and the reader moves and acts with
their heroes, kings, and queens, in most distinguished
company.</p>

<p>I do not like to allude to the recent events
in Spanish history, by which our own country
was forced into collision with Spain; and I
will dismiss the subject merely with the statement
that it has been my endeavour to present
an accurate account of the unfortunate war,
in which I have had the benefit of supervision
by competent authorities.</p>

<p>To them, and to the silent companions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
my voyages and excursions, drawn from the
musty shelves of the library, and frequently
exposed to peril “by flood and field,” I would
herewith express my heartfelt thanks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">ANCIENT IBERIA.</p>

<p class="p2">In the southwestern corner of Europe,
with the Atlantic Ocean on the north and
west, and the Mediterranean Sea south and
east, lies the Iberian Peninsula, eleven thirteenths
of which belong to the country
known as Spain. The other two thirteenths
pertain to Portugal, a country politically distinct
from Spain, but with similar physical
features in the main.</p>

<p>Although we do not know when it first
received its ancient name, Iberia, nor even
whence came its very first peoples, yet we
know that for ages it has existed as a fair
and fertile land, capable of supporting millions
of inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>It is essentially a mountainous country,
for, first of all, there are the Pyrenees, which
partly bound it on the north; the Cantabrian
range, in the northwest; the Guadarrama,
in the central region; and the Sierras Morena
and Nevada, in the south. Between
these mountain ranges lie great tablelands
and deep valleys, the latter traversed by rivers
swift and long, but few of them navigable
far from the sea.</p>

<p>It is its mountainous character that has
given this land, lying as it does beneath a
southern sun, a great diversity of climate;
so that we may say it has at least four climatic
zones: First, the zone of the plateau,
cold in winter and hot in summer, where the
soil is arid; second, that of the northwestern
provinces, with a moist climate; third, that
of the eastern coast, where a balance is preserved
between the two extremes of the
others; and, fourth, the subtropical zone of
the south coast, which is hot as well as
humid.</p>

<p>Thus Spain has a more varied vegetation
than any other country of Europe, for its
high plains and mountainous valleys are almost
Alpine in the character of their flora;
its North Atlantic region has ferns and grassy
meadows, forests of oak, beech, and chestnut;
and the southeast and south a flora that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
almost African, and comprising many species
that are purely tropical.</p>

<p>So we find that Spain, though only six
hundred and fifty miles in greatest length,
and with an area of but little more than one
hundred and ninety thousand square miles,
can boast forests of olives and cork oaks,
hillsides covered with vineyards, valleys filled
with orange trees, almonds, pomegranates,
sugar cane, and with a range of fruits extending
from the apple of the northern region to
the date palm of the south, which last was
brought over from Africa. Honeybees lay
up rich stores from the thyme-covered tablelands,
silkworms flourish in the mulberry
groves of the eastern provinces, and the cochineal
feeds on the cactus of the south.</p>

<p>Not only does the land yield every variety
of food for the sustenance of man, but,
with its thirteen hundred miles of coast line,
Spain has boundless stores of fish, such as
anchovies, tunnies, and salmon in their season.
And again, while almost every species
of the animal as well as the vegetable kingdom
might find a congenial home here, Nature
has not been sparing of her minerals, such as
copper, lead, silver, gold, coal, iron, cobalt,
and quicksilver.</p>

<p>These are some of the natural resources
of Spain, showing, as has been said already,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
that it was bountifully endowed by the Creator
with all things necessary to man’s subsistence,
even though he might through ignorance
prodigally waste them.</p>

<p>We have no authentic history of the first
peoples inhabiting Iberia, but it is believed
that a remnant of their descendants yet
exists in northern Spain, in the Basques,
whose speech and customs differ from those
of all others on the face of the earth. The
Basques claim that they are descended from
the original people, and say, moreover, that
their language was the veritable speech of
Paradise. It is difficult enough to acquire,
at all events, and they have a tradition that
the “Evil One” himself once spent seven
years in attempting to master it, and then
gave up in despair, after having acquired but
two words, “yes” and “no,” which he forgot
as soon as he left the country!</p>

<p>But by the twilight of tradition we observe
an invasion of the peninsula by the
Celts, or Kelts, a wave from the great Aryan
deluge that at one time submerged all Europe,
and which overleaped the Pyrenees and
swept all before it. And these Aryan Kelts,
or Keltic Aryans, became masters of Spain,
not so much through conquest in war as by
intermingling with the natives; and there resulted,
it is said, another and distinct people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
or race, called the Celtiberian. Now, while
the aborigines were probably swarthy and
short of stature, the incoming Kelts were tall
and fair, excellent horsemen, hunters, and
tillers of the soil. As both races were warlike,
their descendants became celebrated, in
after years, for their prowess, and when the
Romans invaded Spain these brave Celtiberians
gave them great trouble, and resisted
subjection to the very last.</p>

<p>They were rude and uncivilized, and, if
they built cities or towns, no remains of such
exist, of which we are aware. In their religion
they were Nature worshippers, blindly
revering the god of day, the stars of night,
and the “phenomena of dawn and sunrise.”
Remains of their rude temples, it is claimed,
have been found in Portugal, where dwelt
that branch of the race known as Lusitanians.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">PH&OElig;NICIANS AND CARTHAGINIANS.</p>

<p class="p2">The native Iberians knew of silver and
gold ore in the hills of southern Spain, which
the Ph&oelig;nician merchant-sailors from Tyre
taught them to utilize, giving them in exchange
the products of their skill, and in
course of time a great trade was carried on
between distant Ph&oelig;nicia on the eastern
shore of the Mediterranean and Iberian
“Tarshish” beyond its western end. Does
not the prophet Ezekiel say, speaking of
Ph&oelig;nician Tyre, “Tarshish was thy merchant,
by reason of the multitude of all kinds
of riches”?</p>

<p>Tarshish, sometimes called by its Latin
form, Tartessus, was the name applied, probably,
to the region about the mouth of the
river Guadalquivir, and perhaps to all that
portion of Spain now known as Andalusia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Here the Ph&oelig;nicians founded the city to-day
known as Cadiz, and which they called
“Gaddir,” or fortress, subsequently named
Gadez by the Romans. Although the Ph&oelig;nician
sailors had long traded here&mdash;for the
founding of cities is not the first occupation
of explorers or traders&mdash;yet the probable
beginning of Cadiz, about 1100 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, or three
thousand years ago, is the first date that
we can even approximately establish in Spanish
chronology.</p>

<p>Two centuries later, or about 900 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
Greek sailors arrived at the Catalonian coast
of northeastern Spain, and there founded a
colony which became prosperous through
its traffic with the natives. The Greeks had
already sailed through the Straits of Gibraltar,
and declared that they had reached the
extreme verge of the habitable globe. In
token of this their great Hercules, or the
Tyrian hero, had set up two monuments, one
on the European and the other on the African
coast, which even to-day are known as the
“Pillars of Hercules.” There are other traditions
referring to Hercules and his connection
with Spain, for it is thought that in this
country he sought the oxen of the triplebodied
Geryones, as he was on his way back
from Gadira (or Gaddir), when he killed the
monster Cacus. And further, there is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
much doubt that the famed “Hesperides”
were located here, from which, as one of the
Herculean “labours,” the son of Zeus was to
fetch the golden apples. Hence it will be
seen that the early traditions of Spain are
very respectably connected! And, moreover,
we should not forget that the Pillars
of Hercules are perpetuated in the American
“dollar mark” ($), the two upright columns,
wreathed within a scroll, according to
a fanciful legend.</p>

<p>In the seventh century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, Gaddir, or
Cadiz, was a flourishing city, as also was
another Ph&oelig;nician settlement on the northeast
coast, Tartessus, or Tarracco, the modern
Tarragona, since famous for its wines and
Roman ruins. During the first centuries of
Ph&oelig;nician commerce with Spain, traditions
tell us, silver was so abundant that the Tyrians
not only loaded their vessels with the
ore, but hammered it into anchors and ballast
for their ships. Gold, silver, and copper
coins were minted and ornaments wrought;
and these, together with other objects of antiquity,
are frequently found to-day&mdash;relics
of the ancient Gaddir, or of Ph&oelig;nician “Cadiz
under the Sea.” Some have held that, while
the first city was founded here, at the mouth
of the Guadalquivir, yet the mines of gold,
silver, and copper were those we find to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
more northerly, in the province of Huelva.
From the port of Huelva, at the mouth of
the Rio Tinto, vast amounts of copper have
been exported in modern times; and, moreover,
this same river, down which the caravels
of Columbus sailed at the very beginning of
their first voyage to America, derived its
ancient name from the copper colour of its
waters.</p>

<p>The Ph&oelig;nicians came here as merchant
rovers; perhaps at times they had acted as
pirates of the sea, but had carried on no war
of conquest. At the most, they colonized a
few seacoast cities, and in exchange for the
natural products of Spain they bestowed upon
the natives the benefits of their civilization,
including, it is thought, the alphabet and the
art of writing.</p>

<p>It was left for the Ph&oelig;nician colony of
Carthage to bring the Iberians directly tributary
to another people, soon after the close of
the first Punic war. Though, according to
tradition, an embassy of Gauls and Iberians
was sent to Alexander the Great, in the fourth
century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, yet they still existed in obscurity
when the great Hamilcar Barca turned
his attention to Spain as a possible recruiting
ground for his depleted armies. Rome had
conquered him in Sardinia and Sicily, which
provinces he had lost to Carthage, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
had been compelled to sue for peace. But his
hatred of Rome was implacable, and, foreseeing
the futility of waging further war from
Africa direct, he passed over into Spain, and
there again built up his forces with recruits
from the wild but fearless Celtiberians.</p>

<p>Hasdrubal, Hamilcar’s son-in-law, who
founded the city of New Carthage, or Cartagena,
in Spain, after Hamilcar was killed, in
the year 228 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, carried on the conquest of
Spain until himself assassinated seven years
later.</p>

<p>Hannibal, son of Hamilcar, was but eighteen
years old when his father died, and twenty-six
when Hasdrubal was killed, but he had
been bred to war from childhood, trained to
fight with the Spanish levies, and taught to
hate the arch-enemy of Carthage. When, as a
boy, he had pleaded with Hamilcar to be taken
with him to Spain, his father had consented
only after he had sworn, on the altar of Jupiter
the Great, eternal enmity to Rome. Not
only was he brought up in camp, sleeping and
eating with the native troops, but in early
manhood he was married to a Spanish woman,
and by this act had won the native soldiers’
regard, as well as by his valour.</p>

<p>Chosen by the troops as Hasdrubal’s successor,
Hannibal began his real campaign
against Rome two years later, 218 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, laying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
siege to Saguntum, a Greek city under
Roman protection, in the province of Valencia.
Famous in history has become that siege
of Saguntum, for the valour of its defenders
and the persistence of its foes, lasting nearly
a year, and ending in its total destruction;
for, finding themselves hemmed in by Hannibal’s
army of one hundred and fifty thousand
men, and their fortifications crumbling
beneath the terrible battering-rams, the Saguntine
soldiers made a vast heap of all
their valuables, gathered around it their
women and children, and sallied forth to
meet their death without the walls. At
the same time the women set fire to the pile
and cast themselves into it, along with their
children; and thus perished the last of the
heroic Saguntines.</p>

<p>You will not find Saguntum on the map
of modern Spain; but in its place, and on its
site, Murviedro&mdash;meaning the old walls&mdash;on
the east coast, north of the city of Valencia.</p>

<p>Thus was ushered in what was known as
the second Punic War&mdash;for Rome promptly
resented this destruction of a colony in alliance
with her; and for the first time sent an
army to Spain. To forestall his enemies,
Hannibal resolved to carry the war into Italy.
That same summer he left the city of Cartagena
with twelve thousand horsemen, thirty-seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
elephants, and ninety thousand foot
soldiers, for the conquest of Rome. He
had been drilling his soldiers and husbanding
his resources for years, in anticipation
of this momentous event; but even then it
would seem that he was poorly prepared to
meet a nation that could put in the field an
army of trained soldiers three times as great
as his. But, after the wonderful passage of
the Alps, when his force had been reduced to
less than six thousand horse and twenty
thousand foot soldiers, Hannibal still pushed
on, to that long and terrible campaign against
Rome, lasting fifteen years, and not to end
until this great commander&mdash;declared to have
been the greatest of his age&mdash;was recalled to
Carthage to assist in its defence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">SPAIN A ROMAN PROVINCE.</p>

<p class="p2">It is not within the scope of our inquiry
to follow the mighty Carthaginian throughout
his marvellous campaign against Rome,
during which he came so close to final success
that he rode up to one of its gates and
threw his spear into the city; but we must
not fail to note that it was planned in Spain,
carried out from that country as a base, and
at first was mainly fought by Celtiberian soldiers.
Meanwhile, though Hannibal had carried
out his scheme of war on a magnificent
scale, and in the end all but brought Rome
to terms, yet in Spain, the country he had
left, affairs had not progressed well with the
Carthaginians.</p>

<p>They had been left with Hannibal’s brother
Hasdrubal in charge, who, after defeating
a Roman army under Cneius Scipio, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
year 212, four years later marched through
Gaul to the assistance of the Africans. He
made the perilous passage of the Alps successfully,
but was surprised and defeated by
the Roman consul Nero, by whose brutal orders
his head was cut off and thrown into
Hannibal’s camp.</p>

<p>The first actual reverses to the Carthaginians
in Spain came through Publius Cornelius
Scipio, who, a Roman ædile of noble appearance,
eloquent and popular, was sent thither
by acclamation to attack them in the rear.
He had already felt the might of Hannibal,
first at the battle of Ticinus&mdash;where he had
saved his father’s life&mdash;at Trebia, and at Cannæ,
where the Romans suffered such terrible
defeats. He met and checked Hasdrubal, but
could not prevent him from crossing the Pyrenees,
and so turned his attention to Cartagena,
the wealthy city on the southern coast.
So well timed were his movements that his
fleet and army arrived there the same day,
and leading his soldiers through a shallow
lake, where the fortifications were the weakest,
after fierce fighting he drove the defenders
from the citadel, took the city, and put every
warrior to the sword. The plunder of this
Carthaginian stronghold was immense, for
besides the five war ships and one hundred
and thirteen merchant vessels in the harbour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
there were brought to him two hundred and
seventy-six golden bowls weighing a pound
apiece, and eighteen thousand pounds of silver,
wrought and coined. Ten thousand prisoners
fell into his hands, including many hostages
of Spanish tribes left as pledges to Hannibal
and Hasdrubal for the fidelity of native
soldiers. These, by a conciliatory policy,
Scipio soon secured as allies, and with their
aid eventually drove the last of the Carthaginians
out of the peninsula. The last city
to fall was Cadiz, in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 206, and in 205 Scipio
returned to Rome, and was elected consul in
recognition of his great achievements.</p>

<p>All this time Hannibal was waging desperate
war against Rome, but in the year 203
he was recalled to Africa, on account of the
threatened invasion by the Romans under
Scipio, who, although he had brought all Carthaginian
Spain under Roman dominion, had
yet failed of the original object of his invasion,
which had been the diversion of Hannibal
from the conquest of Italy. So he resolved
to “carry the war into Africa,” and
so successful was he that Hannibal was
utterly defeated at the battle of Zama, 19th
October, 202 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Peace was concluded between
Rome and Carthage the following
year, but the African city was left shorn of
all her colonial possessions, and in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
pitiable condition as to be no longer a
menace to her foes.</p>

<p>For this great victory Scipio received the
surname of “Africanus,” by which he is known
to history, and brought to a close the second
Punic War, which has been called “the war of
one man (Hannibal) with a nation.” The first,
as we have seen, resulted in the occupation of
Spain by Hamilcar Barca; the second was the
outcome of the destruction of Saguntum by
his son Hannibal; the third and last Punic
War was brought about by the protests of
humiliated Carthage against Roman aggressions,
and ended in its siege, capture, and total
destruction in the year 146 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>Both Hannibal and Scipio Africanus died
in the year 183 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the former an exile,
the latter in retirement at his country seat in
Campania. It was another Scipio, Æmilianus,
who thirty-seven years later acquired the
surname of “Africanus Minor” for his capture
of Carthage; and it was he who carried
out the Roman senate’s orders to raze the
walls, drive the ploughshare over its site,
and sow it with salt.</p>

<p>Three years before the final destruction
of Carthage, died another Roman, Cato,
whose reiterated “<i>Delenda est Carthago</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>”
in 207, and in Africa with the proconsul
Scipio Africanus, whose luxurious mode of
living he denounced. Appointed to a position
in Spain, in the year 195 he crushed a rising
of the Celtiberi, in which his military genius
shone so conspicuously that he was given a
“triumph” when he returned to Rome the
next year.</p>

<p>The Celtiberi were those brave and powerful
people of ancient Spain to whom we
have already alluded. At the time of the Carthaginian
expulsion from the peninsula the
Romans had not conquered the whole of
Spain, for the Celtiberians held all the vast
interior region, where they were firmly intrenched;
and besides these there were yet
unknown and unsubjugated peoples in the
northwest. Scipio’s rule, though brief, was
on the whole salutary, and at this time the
Roman soldiery began to look upon Spain as
a desirable country to settle in after their
terms of service had expired. Many of them
married Spanish women, proconsuls were appointed
from Rome, cities were built, colonies
planted, military roads constructed, and
through these means the Latin language
gradually took the place of native dialects.
In this manner was the Iberian peninsula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Romanized&mdash;which in those days meant civilized.
It became a province of the Roman
Empire, and was divided into Hispania Citerior
and Hispania Ulterior, or Hither and
Farther Spain. Still, Spain yet required prætors
who were invested with consular power,
and some twenty thousand Roman legionaries,
to keep it in order, as the turbulent
Celtiberians, intrenched in their mountain
fastnesses, were constantly threatening an
outbreak.</p>

<p>The elder Gracchus, and after him his two
more famous sons, served as governors of
Hither Spain, and captured more than one
hundred Celtiberian towns. They were eminently
successful, but in or about 154 the
Romans under Mummius suffered a defeat,
and many were massacred by the Lusitanians.</p>

<p>These defeats were avenged and Roman
supremacy restored by a grandson of the
great Marcellus Claudius, who had met and
checked Hannibal after the disaster of Cannæ,
when the Romans lost sixty thousand
men. He founded the city of Cordoba as a
Roman colony, and it soon became a seat of
learning and the home of men eminent in
literature and in the arts of peace. Rome was
now mistress of the Mediterranean, which
from Spain to Syria was “hardly more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a Roman lake.” During the years 147 to
140 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the Lusitanians were in revolt, led
by the gallant Viriathus, a simple herdsman,
who, having seen his people treacherously
massacred, vowed vengeance against the
emissaries of Rome. He cut to pieces army
after army, and at last penned a famous
Roman general and his entire command in a
deep defile, and exacted terms by which Lusitanian
independence was recognised. For
that alone had Viriathus been fighting, and
he was content with that; but the treaty was
repudiated by the Roman senate, and once
more he took the field, only to fall a victim
to treachery and assassination.</p>

<p>The Lusitanian revolt was brought to a
close by the taking of Numantia (134 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>),
after a siege of fifteen months, during which
its inhabitants performed prodigies of valour,
and nearly all of its eight thousand defenders
fell by famine and the sword. The Roman
army, said to have been sixty thousand
strong, was led by no less a personage than
the younger Scipio, Africanus Minor, who
served Numantia as he had unhappy Carthage
twelve years before, and utterly destroyed it.
His work was carried on by others, notably
by Junius Brutus, until all signs of revolution
were extinguished, and the peninsula
was again at peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>But for the invasion of the Cimbri, about
105 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and the turbulent factions of Rome,
Spain would probably have remained quiet
and prosperous; but there came to this country
as an exile one Quintus Sertorius, who
had been a soldier under Marius when he
was opposing Sulla, and espoused his cause.
Upon the downfall of Marius he fled to Spain
and gained a refuge with the Lusitanians,
among which barbarous but brave people
he acquired immense influence. He trained
them in the arts of war, and when the Roman
soldiers came against them, defeated five of
their generals in succession, including the
veteran Metellus. He aimed at establishing
an independent republic in Spain, and perhaps
might have succeeded had not some
of his followers, probably bribed by Roman
gold, treacherously stabbed him at a banquet.</p>

<p>About the time that Sertorius was fighting
the barbarous Cimbri in defence of his native
country, there was born a child who became
known in after years as Pompey. It came
about that, when he had grown to manhood,
he was sent to Spain to defeat and capture
the older soldier, then leader of the revolted
Lusitanians. He was several times defeated
by the wily Sertorius, but after his assassination
he found the matter of pacifying Spain
comparatively easy. He gained repeated victories,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and eventually returned to Rome in
triumph, his star in the ascendant.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this century, so
charged with momentous events, the great
Cæsar was born, five or six years the junior
of Pompey, whose rival he became in later
years for the applause and favours of the
Roman populace. In the year 68 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> he also
went to Spain, having obtained a quæstorship;
and again, in 63, he was given the province
of Farther Spain, where he amassed
great wealth, and gained a military experience
which was of such service to him while
conducting those immortal campaigns in
Britain and Gaul.</p>

<p>Though the civil war between Cæsar and
Pompey had the exclusive possession of
Rome as its object, yet most of their battles
were fought on the soil of Spain. In the
year 49 Cæsar defeated Pompey’s legates in
Spain; the following year he overthrew Pompey
himself at Pharsalia, in Thessaly; but
the final battle was fought about the year 45,
between Cæsar and the sons of his dead
rival.</p>

<p>These great Romans had subdued for
their country the East and the West; had
conquered Gaul and Syria, Britain and
Africa; but the great and decisive conflict,
which was to forever settle the question of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
supremacy between the Roman senate and
the greatest Roman of all time, took place in
Spain! It was at Munda, not far from Cordova,
in the valley of the Guadalquivir, and it is
said that Cæsar himself led the soldiers in the
ranks; saying afterward that though he had
often fought for victory, yet he had never
before fought for his life. More than thirty
thousand men were slain, among them one
of Pompey’s sons; and this great victory made
Cæsar “undisputed master of the Roman
world,” From Spain he returned to a triumph
in Rome; but he was not long to enjoy
the fruits of his victories, the titles of
“<i>Pater patriæ</i>” and “<i>Imperator</i>” for he was
assassinated the following year.</p>

<p>How inextricably interwoven are the
threads of history which bind Rome and
Spain, we may note by glancing at the names
of four only of the former’s greatest men:
Sulla, the first Roman to invade the Eternal
City with her own troops, “set the pace” for
Cæsar at the Rubicon; Sulla’s champion,
Pompey, pursued Sertorius, friend of Marius,
into Spain and accomplished his death; in
his turn, Pompey fell before the might of
Cæsar, who triumphed over all!</p>

<p>While it is true that “peace hath her victories,”
yet they are not often recorded, and
the history of Spain for the next four hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
years is mainly uneventful. But although
Hispania had been freed from participation
in Roman feuds, yet the barbaric population
of the far north was not entirely
subjugated until the time of Augustus, who
finally completed the work begun by the
Scipios and continued by Pompey and Cæsar.
Ten years later, under Marcus Agrippa, Spain
had become completely Latinized, and finally
was considered “more completely Roman
than any other province beyond the limits of
Italy.”</p>

<p>During the Roman occupation cities were
founded, notably Cordova, Saragossa, and
Italica (the latter now in ruins, near Seville);
magnificent public works were constructed,
such as roads, aqueducts, bridges, and amphitheatres.
The best examples of Roman engineering
and architecture may now be found
and studied in Spain, such as an amphitheatre
at Merida, another at Saguntum, the Roman
bridges at Cuenca, Salamanca, and Cordova,
and that splendid bridge over the Guadiana
built by Trajan, which is half a mile long,
thirty-three feet above the river, on eighty-one
arches of granite; the aqueducts of Tarragona,
Evora, and Seville, and that surpassing
piece of engineering work which has
commanded the admiration of centuries,
the aqueduct bridge of Segovia, twenty-six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hundred feet long and one hundred feet in
height.</p>

<p>These material evidences of Roman occupation
may be seen to-day, and besides these,
the finest of Roman coins are frequently discovered.
But more than in mere mechanical
works Rome has left her impress upon Hispania:
in the language spoken there, in the
illustrious names of Roman citizens born
there, such as Trajan and Hadrian, her great
rulers; Lucan, Martial, the two Senecas,
Quintilian, Columella, Pomponius Mela, Silius
Italicus, Florus&mdash;most of whose works are
classics in the Latin tongue.</p>

<p>Thus, while the names of Rome’s greatest
soldiers are written across Spain’s page of

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">A KINGDOM OF THE GOTHS.</p>

<p class="p2">Except for an invasion of the Franks,
about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 256, the peace of Spain was unbroken
for nearly four hundred years. But
in the time of the Roman Emperor Honorius,
the empire having been greatly weakened by
repeated attacks of the northern barbarians,
as well as by the sloth and effeminacy of its
own citizens, her distant provinces soon began
to experience dissensions and invasions.
The death of Stilicho, the trusted adviser of
Honorius and commander of his forces, removed
the only obstacle to Alaric’s advance
upon Rome, and the city yielded to his persistent
attacks. And the same year that
Rome first felt the rude barbarian’s terrible
hand upon her, was also that, if we may believe
the chronicles, in which a host of Suevi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Alani, and Vandals poured over the Pyrenees
and swept across defenceless Spain.</p>

<p>Roman civilization and influence were felt
mainly on the coast and in southern Spain;
in the north and west lived the semi-barbarous
tribes we have already noted, who were now
but loosely held together by the disintegrating
bonds of Rome. Hispania’s conquerors could
do nothing to help her, for was not Rome herself
at the mercy of the Goths, and compelled
to pay an enormous ransom, after enduring
humiliating siege and capitulation? It came
about, however, that the successor of Alaric,
Ataulpha, or Atawulf, made captive lovely
Placidia, sister of Honorius, whom he married
and carried away into Aquitania. Honorius
made the best of the matter and granted to
Atawulf all southern Gaul and Roman Spain,
on condition that he would expel the Suevi
and Alani, and hold the province tributary to
his empire. He accomplished his task, so far
as southern Gaul was concerned, and then
went over the mountains and established his
court at Barcelona, which had been successively
a Ph&oelig;nician, Carthaginian, and Roman
city, and was now held by the Visigoths.</p>

<p>Though Atawulf seems to have been a
faithful ally of Rome, and in her name held
his new kingdom of Hispania-Gothia, as he
called it, yet Honorius sent an army against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
him under Constantius, who, according to report,
was in love with Hacidia before she was
carried off and married by the Goth. Atawulf
was basely assassinated by a creature of his
court, and Constantius made truce with his
successor, on condition that he should be
given possession of Placidia. It was a cheap
purchase of peace, the Goths concluded, and
so the Roman general retired with the widow
of Atawulf as his only captive, and married in
Rome her who became the mother of the future
emperor Valentinian.</p>

<p>Sigric, successor to Atawulf, had murdered
the five children of the latter and compelled
his wife to walk barefoot through the streets
of Barcelona, one historian tells us; yet he
lived but a month to enjoy his ill-gotten
throne, and was followed by the real founder
of the Visigothic kingdom in Spain, the warrior
Walia, whose reign lasted four years,
when he died, and was succeeded by Theodoric.</p>

<p>Walia had reconquered the greater part
of Spain for Rome, and was allowed to recover
the territory of southern Gaul, where
he established his kingdom of Toulouse, and
whither his successor also went to hold court.
Theodoric continued the conquests of his
predecessor, but committed the unpardonable
sin, in the eyes of Rome, of keeping his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
acquisition for himself and the Visigothic
kingdom. In the year 428 the Vandals and
Suevi, under the renowned Genseric, defeated
an allied army of Goths and Romans, for a
long time ravaged all southern Spain, and
then went over into Africa. Some say that
the present name of Andalusia, applied to the
south of Spain, which in Roman times was
called Boetica, was derived from the Vandal
occupation&mdash;Vandalusia, or the land of the
Vandals.</p>

<p>The greatest event of Theodoric’s reign occurred
in the year of his death, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 451, when
the Visigoths, assisted by the allied armies of
Rome and the Franks, defeated Attila the
Hun, that famed “Scourge of God,” who had
thus far led his horde of “beasts on two legs”
out of the east and the north, to the ravage
of the south.</p>

<p>Theodoric was killed on the field of battle,
and the crown fell to a son, Theodoric II,
after him to another son, Euric, or Evaric,
who defied the waning power of Rome, and
finally threw it off and brought the peninsula
under the sole supremacy of the Visigoths.</p>

<p>Under Alaric II, who became king upon
the death of Euric, the Visigoths lost nearly
all their possessions north of the Pyrenees,
and became more particularly a Spanish people.
Their capital was established at Toledo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
that ancient and interesting city on the Tagus,
and, as compared with the other invaders,
they were cultured and polished. At the same
time they were more virile than the Romans,
hence had been able to expel the latter and
subdue the former. They were not, however,
sufficiently civilized to hold sacred human
life, and especially they secured a reputation
as regicides, so many kings of theirs were
murdered. During the three hundred years
of their dominion in Spain they had thirty-three
kings ruling over them, many of whom
fell by the assassin’s knife.</p>

<p>By sword and good right arm, the Visigothic
kings generally won their thrones, but
the time came when they were dominated by
the Church. To show how this came about,
we must look back to the time when, a menace
to Rome and a terror to all southern Europe,
the barbarous Goths descended from
their northern fastnesses. They were pagans
then, enemies of the true faith, until between
the years 340 and 380 they were converted
to Christianity by one Ulfilas, who invented
an alphabet for them and translated much of
the New Testament into Gothic. This was
about the middle of the fourth century; but
even when Alaric was thundering at the gates
of Rome, it is said that the Goths held more
seriously the tenets of their faith and were of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
purer morals than those from whom they had
received their new religion.</p>

<p>Now, the primitive Christianity which the
Goths had received from Ulfilas was silent
as to the mysteries and the dogmas which
had gathered around the religion of Rome
during the centuries which had passed. They
still held to the primitive faith taught them
by Ulfilas and their Gothic Bible. In a word
(without pretending to say which might have
been right, or which party wrong), the Goths
were Arians in their belief, while the Romans
of Spain and their converts were Trinitarians.
There were other minor differences
between them, but so long as this radical discrepancy
existed between the two religions,
they were always at odds. This trouble was
brought to a head in the time of King Leovigild,
who reigned from <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 567 to 586,
and who was such a rigid Arian that he finally
beheaded a beloved son for becoming a convert
to and publicly professing a belief in the
Roman religion. This son, Hermenigild, had
married a French wife who was a Roman
Catholic and who had been the means of his
conversion, and encouraged him to lead a revolt
against his father. He received his reward
in the sixteenth century, when he was
canonized as a saint.</p>

<p>King Leovigild was succeeded by another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
son, Recared, who, though he had stood by
and seen his brother executed for opinion’s
sake, and whom his father thought to be a
good Arian, yet became a Catholic soon after
his coronation. With the zeal peculiar to all
new converts, he insisted that all his subjects
should become Catholics also, and rooted out
the “Arian heresy” wherever he could find
it. Recared was the first Catholic king of
Spain, but not the last bigot, for he lighted
the fires of religious persecution, which burned
so brightly and balefully through many succeeding
centuries. Not content with causing
all the Goths to renounce their Arianism, he&mdash;or
the priests, at his suggestion&mdash;turned
upon the Jews of the kingdom and threatened
them with expulsion unless they also recanted.</p>

<p>Thus in the last years of the sixth century
the Church acquired a voice in royal
affairs, and the Gothic monarchy became
elective and dependent very much upon the
choice of the bishops.</p>

<p>During the next seventy years twelve kings
occupied the throne, each king seated at the
pleasure of the bishops, and sometimes unseated&mdash;not
without violence&mdash;at their dictation.
Of all the Gothic monarchs who reigned
in the capital city of Toledo, perhaps none
has been held in more sacred remembrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
than King Wamba, who, a simple shepherd,
was made a king against his will, and then,
after he had acquired a liking for the throne,
was deposed, also against his will, even after
he had performed prodigies of valour for his
country. It seems that the clerical party
wanted him for king because they thought
he might be a pliant instrument in their
hands, like his predecessors. But Wamba
had a will of his own, so a person of his
court, one Ervigius by name, was persuaded
to administer a cup of poison to the obstinate
old man, which plunged him into a
sleep so deep that his attendants thought
him about to die.</p>

<p>Now it was a tradition of the Church that
no king, no matter what his previous life had
been, could receive the blessings of the future
life unless he died garbed in the habit of
a monk. So his servants dressed Wamba in
a monk’s cowl and cloak, and when he recovered
his senses&mdash;for he did not die just
then&mdash;he was almost insane with rage; for,
according to the same unwritten law of the
Church, once in the cowl, never more could
one reign a king; and so poor old Wamba
made the best of it, though protesting that
it was a very scurvy trick, and retired to a
cloister, where he passed the remainder of his
days. All this occurred about the year 680,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and it is averred that then began the dissensions,
caused by the desire for ecclesiastical
supremacy, which divided the Gothic kingdom
against itself, and caused its downfall about
thirty years later.</p>

<p>Wamba was succeeded by the usurper Ervigius,
or Erwic&mdash;the same who had sent the
old king to a cell&mdash;who reigned seven years,
and after him came Egica and Witica, who
between them carried Gothic domination up
to the year 710, when the portents were
strong for some unknown disaster. Church
and state had been in the main united hitherto,
or since the advent of Recared; but now
there were signs of dissolution, and the final
severance came with the elevation of King
Roderick.</p>

<p>Around King Roderick, “the last of the
Goths,” cluster legends and traditions so
thickly that it is difficult to separate fiction
from truth. If you would know to what extent
fable and fiction have enmeshed him, read
Washington Irving’s fascinating Legend of
Don Roderick. He was a son of a brave
Goth, Duke Theodifred, who was blinded and
imprisoned by orders of King Witica; but he
succeeded in hurling the tyrant from his
throne and inflicting upon him the same punishment.
He banished the sons of Witica and
set himself to work reforms; but the kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
had been so weakened by the foolish and
evil deeds of his late predecessors, and he
found himself so surrounded by enemies
(friends and relations of the former king),
that he could not save it from ruin. He was
to be known to history as the last reigning
sovereign before the kingdom was overthrown
by that mighty Moslem host from Africa.
Some Spanish chroniclers have sought to account
for this overthrow by ascribing to Don
Roderick a foul deed done to a daughter of a
certain Count Julian, commander of the Gothic
forces in Africa, and the name of fair Florinda
has come down to us coupled in infamy with
that of the king. But the truth probably is
that, while Count Julian’s defection did assist
the African invasion, yet the real reason for
it runs further back, to the time when the
ecclesiastics began to meddle in royal affairs,
and especially when their bigotry led to the
expulsion of the Jews, who, settling along
the North African coast, conspired with the
Moors to obtain a foothold in that fair land
across the straits.</p>

<p>The sad truth is that the Gothic reign was
near its end; it was to perish from the earth,
leaving few memorials of its existence save
a lasting impress upon the speech of Spain,
which has been called “a Gothic language
handled in a Latin grammar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Another race was to occupy the land successively
won by Roman and Visigoth; and
to obtain a clear conception of the manner
in which the conquest was effected we must
review the previous century.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">THE INVASION FROM AFRICA.</p>

<p class="p2">Within ninety years after <i>El Hijra</i>&mdash;the
“flight of Mohammed”&mdash;which occurred
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 622, Syria, Persia, and North Africa were
brought under the control of his fanatical
followers. The city of Damascus was taken
in 634; in 640, Alexandria, when six million
Copts are said to have embraced the religion
of their conquerors. Moslem bigotry, ignorance,
and fanaticism are well illustrated
in the burning of the famous Alexandrian
Library, according to the decree of Omar the
Califa: “If these writings of the Greeks
agree with the Koran, they are useless and
need not be preserved; if they disagree, they
are pernicious and ought to be destroyed!”</p>

<p>North Africa at that time was known by
the names of its Roman provinces, such as
Numidia, Mauritania, and Tingitania, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
these were successively overrun and subjugated
by the trusted general Musa (or Moses),
who was made Emir of Africa and supreme
commander. One of his six noble sons captured
the coast city of Tangier, command of
which was given to a veteran of Damascus
named Tarik Ibn Zeyad, who had lost an eye
in the wars and was known as <i>el Tuerto</i>, or
“Tarik the One-eyed.” His force was small,
but composed mainly of Berbers, or natives
of North Africa recently converted to the
Moslem faith, and as fierce and fanatical as
himself.</p>

<p>At that time the chief Gothic stronghold
in Africa was Ceuta, the ancient Abyla of
the Greeks, and forming, with Gibraltar,
or Calpa, on the European side of the
straits, the famed “Pillars of Hercules”&mdash;mentioned
in our account of the Ph&oelig;nician
voyages. In command of the forces at
Ceuta was Count Julian, who for reasons not
known, but probably because he was a relative
of the late King Witica and wanted to
punish Don Roderick, offered to lead the
Moslems to conquest in Spain if they would
reward him as his treason deserved. So, under
his directions, Tarik the One-eyed was
sent across the Straits of Hercules and landed
with a small force at Tarifa, the southernmost
town in Spain as well as in all Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
It is said to have derived its name from the
Moslem commander Tarif, or Tarik, and
this name also is perpetuated in our word
“tariff.” But however it was, Tarik saw
enough to convince him that Spain could be
easily invaded, if not readily conquered, and
so went back with a report to that effect to
Musa the emir, laden with the spoils of his
ravage.</p>

<p>Having received permission from the
Califa at Bagdad to invade the country
across the straits, Musa gathered an army of
twelve thousand men and sent it over under
the command of the fierce Tarik, who landed
this time at Calpa, since named, after him,
<i>Gebel el Tarik</i>, or Gibraltar, and made that
the base of his operations against the unfortunate
country. The apostate Count Julian
joined him and served as a guide in this the
first real invasion of Spain by a Moslem
army. In short, the invaders were strongly
re-enforced by the discontented masses of
that section of Spain, the maltreated Jews
and the debased agricultural classes, who saw,
or thought they saw, freedom from a yoke
that had galled them for generations and
had grown heavier with succeeding years.
Besides, they did not think that the Moslems
would more than ravage the country and perhaps
attempt to destroy the military power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of the Goths, and then would retire to the
land from which they had come. There are
two things, at least, we should note: first,
that the army of Tarik was composed mainly
of native Africans, then called Moors or Berbers;
and that they had come with the settled
purpose of conquest and plunder. In
order to enforce upon his men the desperate
nature of their task, Tarik caused his ships to
be burned, and thus impressed them with the
fact that they must either conquer or be
destroyed&mdash;for they could not retreat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the gallant but unfortunate
King Roderick had done his best to arouse
the disunited kingdom to a sense of its impending
danger, and had gathered an army
of one hundred thousand men to resist the
approaching infidels. The opposing forces
met on a plain near Xeres, on the banks
of the river Guadalete, and, after two days
of desperate fighting, victory crowned the
efforts of Tarik and his traitorous allies.
Owing to the defection of Bishop Oppas, a
brother of King Witica, and the latter’s two
sons, at a most critical moment, when they
and all their followers went over to the enemy,
the field was lost to King Roderick,
who vanished from the scene completely, and
was never seen or heard of more.</p>

<p>The base Julian, the bishop, and the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
princes were rewarded for their perfidy, it is
related, by a gift of the three thousand farms
pertaining to the crown. Thus, after three
centuries of dominion, extending from about
410 to 711 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, the Goths were driven from
the throne they had won by the sword and
held by force; for the battle of Guadalete
was a decisive blow to the disintegrating
kingdom, and after that the advance of the
Moorish armies was almost unopposed. It
may well be imagined that the warlike Tarik
was not satisfied to rest here, when before
him was all Spain, with wealthy cities to sack,
fertile regions to be possessed, and a numerous
population to be converted to Islamism
or to escape only by paying tribute.</p>

<p>Although the conquerors professed the
same religion, bowed to the same prophet,
and waged war for the same great calif in
the East, yet they were not all of the same
nationality, for in the army of invasion were
not only Arabs, but Moors, Egyptians, and
Syrians. In time, however, all came to be
called by the name of Moors, though their
differences of birth and divergence of views
led to serious quarrels among them. The
first estrangement was when Musa, the emir,
finding that Tarik had disobeyed his orders,
and, instead of returning to Africa after defeating
the Goths in battle and acquiring vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
plunder, had pursued his conquests toward
the north, hastily gathered another army and
followed on his tracks.</p>

<p>Musa found, however, that though Tarik
had followed up his victory by effectually
scattering the defeated Goths, and even taking
the capital city, Toledo, there was yet
room for another conqueror to operate; so,
instead of immediately pursuing Tarik, after
he had landed he made a detour through
Andalusia and took Medina Sidonia and the
rich Roman city of Seville. Then, though
gorged with plunder enough to have satisfied
a king, he pushed on after and overtook the
recreant Tarik at the city of Toledo. “I
gave thee orders to make a foray only, then
return to Africa,” he said to the veteran,
“yet thou hast marched through all this territory
without my permission.” The warrior
received this reproof in silence, and for a
time a truce was made between them; they
pushed on their conquests, the one into the
northwest, the other into the north and east,
until only the Pyrenees separated them from
the country of the Gauls.</p>

<p>Between them they brought all Spain under
subjection, with the exception of certain
remote districts, which they thought too small
or too distant to be attacked. But it was
within the confines of these small mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
valleys of the northwest that, protected by
their rugged barriers, the defeated Goths
halted and found a home, and gathered as a
nucleus for future forays upon their enemies;
as we shall see.</p>

<p>When the country had been practically
conquered, the quarrel between Musa and
Tarik was renewed; finally it reached the
ears of the Calif at Bagdad that his most
valiant generals were fighting like jackals
over their prey, and he summoned them both
to the Orient, there to give account of themselves.
It would seem that gratitude was a
sentiment entirely foreign to the Arab character,
as instanced not only on this occasion,
but on many another during the conquest
and continuance of the Moors in Spain; for,
in spite of his inestimable services to the
califate, notwithstanding he had given to the
Moslems a new country as their own, and
had extended the sway of Islam westward
to the Atlantic, Musa was degraded, even
sentenced to death, and finally ended his life
in poverty.</p>

<p>But despite the severity of Oriental rule,
Spain continued a tributary to the Eastern
califs until about the middle of the century
in which it was conquered, when (as we shall
see in due course) an independent califate
was established in Cordova. Musa had left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
as emir in his absence his favourite son Abdalasis,
who governed the conquered territory
wisely, but had the misfortune, during
his father’s absence, to see and fall in love
with beautiful Exilona, the unhappy widow
of the departed King Roderick. They were
married; but as he was a Moslem and she a
Christian, soon there began murmurs among
their subjects, notwithstanding the generous
nature of Abdalasis, who had ever in mind
their well-being. These rumours reached the
ears of the Calif, cruel and bloodthirsty Suleiman,
and he sent orders that the devoted
pair should be murdered. His commands
were obeyed: both were basely killed while
at morning prayers, and the head of Abdalasis
was embalmed and sent in a casket to Syria,
to the court of the Calif. The unfortunate
Musa was in attendance at the court, and
when the casket arrived the Calif took out
the head of Abdalasis and held it up before
his victim:</p>

<p>“Dost thou know this head?” he demanded.
Musa gazed in anguish. “Yes,” he murmured,
“well do I know it; and may the curse
of God light upon him who has destroyed
a better man than himself!” The stricken
father did not long survive this terrible
stroke; but the wrath of Suleiman was not
appeased until the other sons of Musa, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
he had left at important posts in Africa, were
also numbered with the dead.</p>

<p>Still, despite the ingratitude and cruelty of
the Califas, able generals were found to carry
on the war for Islam, until even the Pyrenees
were leaped and the Moslem hosts invaded
France. It seemed as though all Europe
would become subject to the bonds of the
Arabs, and soon be brought to acknowledge
the “one God and Mohammed his prophet.”
But in the year 732, twenty-one years after
the invasion of Spain, the tide was turned at
Tours, when Charles Martel slew thirty thousand
Moslems and turned back the remainder,
eventually to retreat to the land whence they
had come. No other country suited them so
well, and here they lived, they and their descendants,
from first to last, more than eight
hundred years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">THE WESTERN CALIFATE.</p>

<p class="p2">Within three years after their first appearance
in Spain the Moors had subjected
nearly the entire territory, save only a restricted
region in the north and west. For
about fifty years thereafter they were governed
by emirs sent from the califate of Damascus,
and the last of some twenty emirs
was one Yusef, an Abbasside. To understand
the Arab terms which we are now compelled
to use in relating this portion of Spain’s history,
we must transport ourselves once again
to the Orient, and glance at the line of califs,
or caliphs, successors to Mahomet, or Mohammed,
which had carried on his conquests
for many years.</p>

<p>The Prophet left no direct heirs, and this
led to continual wrangling among the various
tribes; even the succession of Abu-bekr, father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of Mohammed’s favourite wife Ayeshah,
did not settle anything, for at his death the
question was reopened. Not right, but might,
however, prevailed with the Arabs, and about
the year 661 the first calif of the Ommiades
seated himself at Damascus. One of this line
was in power when Spain was invaded, but
about the middle of the eighth century three
brothers came forward to dispute his rights.
The calif was killed, and eighty Ommiades of
influence, invited to a feast at Damascus, were
murdered in cold blood. Thus arose the line
of Abbassides, so called from alleged descent
from Abbas, uncle of Mohammed. Like most
of the Arab rulers, the Abbassides signalled
their rise to power by deeds of blood, their
first effort being toward the entire obliteration
of the house of Ommiades. But two of
this noble house escaped: one fled to Arabia,
where his descendants ruled a while; and
the other to Africa, where, among the devoted
adherents of his line, the Bedouins and the
Berbers, he passed several years under their
protection.</p>

<p>It happened that most of the Moslem
chiefs in Spain were also allied to the house
of Ommiades, and when they learned that the
young Syrian Abderrahman was wandering
in Africa a fugitive, with a price upon his
head, they earnestly entreated him to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
over and become their ruler. Yusef, the last
emir of the Abbassides, was routed in battle
and sent away, and Spain at last made independent
of Eastern influence under a king of
her own&mdash;the first of a line which governed,
in the main wisely, for nearly three hundred
years.</p>

<p>Prince Abderrahman made the city of Cordova
the seat of the Western califate, and under
him it became a centre of learning as well
as prosperity, rivalling all other cities of the
peninsula. Magnificent palaces were built,
hospitals and mosques, one of the last named
being the glorious mosque of Cordova, its
site four acres in extent, renowned throughout
the world for its beauty. This was begun
by Abderrahman in the year 786, and has
lasted to our time, with its unrivalled mosaics,
tiles, and arabesques, and its thousand
columns of porphyry and alabaster.</p>

<p>Then were begun those vast irrigation
works which reclaimed the desert plains of
the country and made them flourish with
vegetation; the immense aqueducts, the
bridges, towers, and walls of defence. And
yet the reign of Abderrahman was by no
means a peaceful one, as he had to placate
the many different sects and tribes of his own
countrymen on the one hand, and the Jews
and Christians on the other. In the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
was a turbulent Christian population, ever at
war; in the south, a Mohammedan population
always quarrelling over the division of
spoils, and particularly of the conquered
territory.</p>

<p>Toward the last of his reign there appeared
in the north a mightier than he&mdash;no less than
the magnificent Charlemagne, Emperor of the
French, who, about the year 778, having been
invited thither by a disaffected Arab captain,
crossed the Pyrenees and captured several
towns. He did not stay long, however, for a
rising of the Saxons called him back, after
he had taken Saragossa and razed the walls
of Pampeluna. Perhaps his brief campaign
in Spain might never have been chronicled
had it not been for his disastrous rout
in the Pyrenean Pass of Roncesvalles, and
the death of that hero of early song, the gallant
Roland, a semi-mythical figure in history.
It was for a long time believed that they were
infidel Saracens who attacked and destroyed
Charlemagne’s rear guard in the Pass of
Roncesvalles; but later investigations show
them to have been Basques, descendants of
the primitive Iberians, who resented this invasion
of their territory, even by a grandson
of the great Charles Martel, who had beaten
back the Moslems in 732 and 737.</p>

<p>Abderrahman died in 788, and was succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
by Hicham I, and he by others of the
line, whose moral tone may be indicated by
the remark of one Mohammed, eldest of
forty-five brothers, who, when congratulated
by a favourite upon his elevation, exclaimed:
“What an absurd idea to say this world would
be beautiful if there were no death! If there
were no death, should <i>I</i> be reigning? Death
is a good thing; my predecessor is dead; that
is why I reign.” Another calif before him,
who refused to treat Christian and Mussulman
alike in the eyes of the law, invited seven
hundred citizens of Toledo to a banquet, admitting
each one separately within the doorway
of his castle, when he was seized and
taken to the parapet, where his head was
lopped off and thrown into the fosse. But
this was only a playful manifestation of power,
which caused the calif to be regarded as
eccentric, rather than cruel or bloodthirsty.</p>

<p>During the reign of Abderrahman II the
Spanish coast was ravaged by the Norman
sea-robbers, who even sailed up the river
Guadalquivir as far as Seville, and with whom
the Arab navy is said to have had a great sea
fight; though this is doubtful. One hundred
years later&mdash;the interim being filled with three
inconsequential rulers&mdash;another, Abderrahman
III, carried Cordova and the califate to
the summit of power. He held the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
for nearly fifty years, from 912 to 961, and
came to be one of the wealthiest rulers in the
then known world. The city contained half
a million inhabitants, one hundred thousand
houses, and twenty-eight suburbs, and the
surplus population was urged to dwell in a
new city outside the walls, which was called
Zahra, after one of Abderrahman’s six thousand
wives, and which rivalled the finest city
of the Orient in the beauty of its palaces.</p>

<p>Material and intellectual growth kept
even pace, and Cordova was a torch of enlightenment
during that time which in Europe
was known as the “Dark Ages.” The
son of Abderrahman III, who reigned fifteen
years as Hacam II, was a gifted bibliophile,
if not a scholar, for he collected, read, and
annotated (it is said) a library of four hundred
thousand volumes. From distant Cairo,
Bagdad, and Damascus he drew the precious
books which went to swell his great catalogue
of forty-four volumes; and among them, at
one time, was the veritable copy of the Koran
stained by the blood of Othman, who was
beheaded in the year 650. The University
of Cordova was known abroad, and hither
flocked scholars, poets, and Arab singers,
while thousands of students listened to eloquent
teachers of theology and law. Of all
the cities of Spain, none rivals in interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
golden Cordova, on the banks of the Guadalquivir&mdash;though
Seville, Granada, and Toledo
press it close&mdash;either in the list of famous
Arabs or Romans, born and educated here.</p>

<p>Skilled in astrology and astronomy we
know they were, and from Cordova, in the
latter half of the tenth century, were obtained
the Arabic numerals, which were carried to
Rome by Pope Sylvester II, it is said, soon
after he had studied at the university; and
where, doubtless, he acquired those attainments
in mathematics, chemistry, and philosophy
which caused it to be said of him
that he was in league with the devil.</p>

<p>From the name Cordova, also, we get
the term “cordwainer,” out of “<i>cordovan</i>,”
the celebrated leather manufactured there.
Many arts and a few sciences flourished in
this noble city; and we should not forget
our indebtedness to the Spanish Arabs, who
kept alight the lamp of learning, and who
have left in their architecture, if in nothing
else, a memorial of their greatness.</p>

<p>Under another calif, Hicham II, the Moors
in Spain reached the zenith of their prosperity;
but not through any act of the calif himself,
except negatively, when he resigned all
power to his <i>hadjib</i>, or <i>vizier</i>, Abou-Amir Mohammed,
who under the surname of <i>Almansor
Billah</i>&mdash;“victorious by help of God”&mdash;nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
destroyed the rising Christians of the north.
The renowned hero of more than fifty battles,
Almansor carried death and destruction
to all parts of rebellious Spain. He marched
upon and captured the cities of Leon, Barcelona,
Pampeluna, Salamanca, and Zamora;
but the greatest of his achievements&mdash;that
upon which he most prided himself&mdash;was the
sacking of the sacred shrine of Campostella,
and the hanging of its bells of bronze in the
great mosque at Cordova, where they were
used as lamps.</p>

<p>Campostella, or the Field of the Star, was
the holy spot where, according to early
Christian legend, the body of Saint James
the apostle was found, having been brought
here by his disciples. Its discovery, after
having been for centuries buried here, was
owing to the shining of a star of exceeding
lustre above the sacred spot, and hence the
name applied to the church subsequently
erected here, and which became a shrine for
pilgrims from all parts of Christian Spain.
As scallop shells are found here imbedded in
the rock, a shell of this sort was the pilgrim’s
badge; but was not, it need hardly be said,
respected by the fierce Almansor.</p>

<p>Calif in all save name, Almansor ruled
supreme; whenever he went to battle&mdash;and
which always ended in victory for the Moslem&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
took with him forty poets to chant
his praises and sing his greatness. Yet he
too died, at last; with his departure began
the decline of Moorish and the consequent
rise of Christian power. But for more than
two centuries longer the Moors were to
dwell&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">SPAIN’S HEROIC AGE.</p>

<p class="p2">We have followed the Moors in Spain
through the first three hundred years of their
history. Let us now retrace our steps and
pursue the fleeing Goths, when, after their
defeat on the banks of the Guadalete, they
left all southern Spain in the hands of the invaders.
“At the time of the general wreck
of Spain by the sudden tempest of Arab (African)
invasion,” says Washington Irving,
“many of the inhabitants took refuge in the
mountains of the Asturias, burying themselves
in narrow valleys difficult of access,
wherever a constant stream of water afforded
a green bosom of pasture land and scanty
fields for cultivation. For mutual protection
they gathered together in small villages,
called <i>castros</i> or <i>castrellos</i>, with watch-towers
and fortresses on impending cliffs, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
they might shelter and defend themselves in
case of sudden inroad. Thus arose the kingdom
of the Asturias, of Pelayo and the king’s
successors, who gradually extended their
dominion, built towns and cities, and after a
time fixed their seat of government at the
city of Leon. An important part of the region
over which they bore sway was ancient
Cantabria, extending from the Bay of Biscay
to the Duero, and called Castile, from the
number of castles with which it was studded.”</p>

<p>By referring to a map of Spain you will
find the Asturias in the far north, all of four
hundred miles from the scene of the disastrous
battle; and here it was, in the mountain
valleys, surrounded by frowning peaks
and gloomy gorges, that Pelayo the Cave
King, first ruler of the Goths after their defeat,
established his little kingdom. Living
at first in caves, then in rude habitations of
earth and stone, the hardy mountaineers
gradually gathered in hamlets and villages,
and in a few years were strong enough to
resist the forces that finally penetrated to
their abode. With their backs against the
mountain walls, from the brinks of dizzy
precipices, they hurled down rocks and trees
upon the invading Africans, and drove them
back to ravage the more fertile plains below.</p>

<p>Pelayo the Cave King is said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
been the son of a noble Goth who was banished
by Witica, but who returned to serve
Roderick as sword-bearer on the fatal field
of Guadalete. Little is known of his career,
and by some he is treated as a myth; but
the Spaniards believe in his existence, and in
recent years one of Spain’s most powerful
battleships received the name of this first
king who stemmed the tide of Moorish conquest.</p>

<p>To the Asturias was later united Galicia,
in the extreme northwest of Spain, then Leon
farther south; the Moslems soon encountered
opposition in Navarra, to the east of Leon,
in Aragon, still farther toward the eastern
coast, and finally in Catalonia, where the
Counts of Barcelona fought the Saracens in
their ancient seaport founded by the father
of Hannibal. The story of the reconquest
of Spain&mdash;in its first stages at least&mdash;is long
and complicated, involving the development
of no less than six separate provinces: Aragon,
Catalonia, Navarra, Asturias, Castile,
and Leon, stretching across the country from
the Atlantic to the Mediterranean. But,
without descending to wearisome detail in
the narration of the feuds and fights of petty
kings and chiefs, we should note, first of all,
that the first stand against the Moslems was
in the north. There, with their castled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
towns and hamlets defended by the almost
inaccessible mountain ranges, the Goths drew
valour and might from the difficulties of their
situation, and soon were developed scores
and hundreds of heroes, whose sole occupation
was war; fighting often among themselves,
but always ready to unite against the
common enemy, the hated Moslem.</p>

<p>We have already had a glimpse of this
unhappy country during the reign of the
Ommiades, and have seen that, while the
Moor might be victorious in one direction,
the Christian would prevail in another. But,
with the mountains behind them ever, as
places of refuge and retreat, the growing
hosts of the Christians became more and
more annoying to the Moors. Under the
first Alfonso, between the years 739 and 756,
the territory of Leon was greatly extended,
while during the reign of Alfonso II (791-842)
this king, who had allied himself with
the great Charlemagne, founded the cities of
Oviedo and Compostella, and raided the region
southward to Portugal. There are so
many and various Alfonsos, Ferdinands, Sanchos,
Pedros, Don Juans, Ordoños, etc., rulers
over different kingdoms and over the
same territory at different times, that it will
be impossible to narrate the doings of them
all. But, however they might quarrel among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
themselves, they were persistent in their opposition
to the Moors, through decades and
centuries, until finally the detested infidels
were expelled from Spain.</p>

<p>We can, however, merely glance at those
most conspicuous for gallantry, for deeds of
daring, and mention only those great battles
that were decisive in their effect upon the
general welfare of Spain and the progress of
the hosts engaged in its reconquest. During
the reign of Alfonso the Victorious, one of
his Moorish neighbours invaded his territory
and ravaged his fields, until he was met and
defeated by that gallant hero, Bernardo del
Carpio, who cut off the Moslem’s head and
took it to Alfonso as a precious gift. Having
performed such a service for his sovereign,
it might be supposed that Bernardo
would be richly rewarded; but, far from that
being the case, his father was kept in prison,
upon some pretext, by Alfonso, and Bernardo’s
great services were ignored. At last,
wearied by the injustice of which he was the
victim, Bernardo resolved to leave Alfonso’s
court and go over to the Moors. He shut
himself up in his castle of Carpio, from which
he made many a pillaging raid into the territory
of his king, until at last Alfonso besieged
him there. But Bernardo’s defence
was so valiant that the king offered to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
him possession of his father if he would yield
up his castle. This was a great price to pay,
but the devoted son at once agreed to it.
The treacherous Alfonso sent assassins who
murdered Count Sancho in prison, then
seated his corpse upon a horse, richly attired,
and led him to meet Bernardo. When
the latter saw him coming he went to meet
him, and not until he had taken his father’s
hand to kiss it did he discover the cruel deception.
Then he turned his face aside and
cried: “Ah my father, Don Sancho Diaz, in
an evil hour didst thou beget me. Thou art
dead, and I&mdash;I have given my stronghold for
thee, and now indeed have lost all!”</p>

<p class="p2">Some time later reigned one Alfonso III
(from 866-909), who gained many a victory
over the Moors, but who unwisely divided
his kingdom, at his death, among several
sons, and thus brought about the disunion of
territory already united, and retarded the
general advance of Christian power so amply
extended by the prowess of his arms. Before
him, however, came King Ramiro, whose short
reign was made memorable by his refusal to
pay to Abderrahman the customary tribute,
which had been agreed upon by some of his
predecessors, of one hundred beautiful maidens
annually. In the <i>patio</i> of the <i>Alcázar</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Seville is shown to-day the spot where these
disconsolate maidens, abandoned by their
friends to the savage mercies of the Moors,
were gathered when this base bargain was
carried out. But Ramiro refused to pay this
tribute, and so Abderrahman sent an army
against him which, after two days of terrible
fighting, the Christians destroyed.</p>

<p>In the noble city of Burgos stands the
statue of another hero of that age, Fernan
Gonzalez, grandson of one of the first judges
of Castile, after that province had thrown
off its allegiance to Leon. When Fernan
Gonzalez was but seventeen years old he was
elected to rule, under Alfonso the Great, with
the title of count. A Moorish captain was
ravaging the territory of Castile at that very
time, and Count Fernan placed himself at the
head of a small body of troops and set out to
meet him. He was successful, and returned
to Burgos with immense booty, part of which
he used for the endowment of a convent.
After that he kept the field almost continually,
widening the range of his conquests until
Castile was freed from the Moors. But his
great successes gained for him the ill will
of other Christian kings and leaders, notably
of Sancho, King of Navarre, with whom he
was obliged to fight, and whom he killed in
single combat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>A son of Sancho the Fat (who was cured of
obesity by a Moorish physician), Don Garcia,
surnamed “the Trembler,” finding himself
unable to cope with Count Fernan in the open
field, resorted to treachery, and, having proposed
that he should marry his sister, when
Fernan went to claim her, with but a feeble
guard, he was captured by the wily Garcia
and thrown into a dungeon. The Princess
Sancha, the lady in question, wondered why
her lover did not come to take her away as
his bride, and when she finally learned the
truth&mdash;heard that an honourable cavalier was
languishing in chains for her sake, in a dismal
dungeon&mdash;she bribed the guards, appeared
before the count an angel of beauty, and led
him forth to liberty, after first exacting an
oath that he would make her his wife as soon
as they were safe within the confines of his
domains.</p>

<p>And, after many perilous adventures, they
arrived safely in the city of Burgos, where
the princess was welcomed with acclamation
as the future “first lady of the land,” and
their marriage was followed by feastings,
tilts, and tournaments. Garcia the Trembler
followed hard after them with his army, but
in the battle that eventuated he was taken
prisoner, though subsequently sent home
laden with honours, at the intercession of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
sister; which shows what a noble gentleman
Count Fernan was, and what a jewel he got
for a wife.</p>

<p>Such are the stories told of the heroic
days of early Spain, chiefly of Castile, when
continual fighting between Moors and Christian
had wrought the warriors to the highest
state of efficiency. They were not happy
unless engaged in warfare, and this accounts
for the many feuds among the Goths themselves;
and it was owing to their continual
dissensions that the reconquest of all Spain
was so long delayed. And yet, among the
Moors there was still greater dissension, on
account of the hatred that existed between
the Arabs and the Berbers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">DECLINE OF THE MOORS.</p>

<p class="p2">The eleventh and twelfth centuries were
momentous ones to Spain, and in the hundred
years between 1000 and 1100 more battles
were fought, perhaps, and more victories
gained by the Christians, than in any equal
period before. The great Almansor of Cordova,
who had inflicted upon the Goths defeat
after defeat, himself lost a battle, at
Catalañazor, in the year 1001 or 1002, which
caused his death. A rebellion in Morocco
had compelled him to send an army thither,
and the Christians had taken advantage of
this weakening of his forces and fallen upon
him at the Leon and Castile frontier.</p>

<p>Almansor’s death weakened the Ommiade
dynasty, and Cordova fell a prey to discord;
in place of one strong ruler now were many
petty chiefs, each one anxious to make himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
supreme, but only succeeding in adding to
the confusion then prevailing among the
Moors. Before the middle of the century
the crowns of Leon and Castile had been
united under Ferdinand the Great, and in the
year 1082 his son and successor, Alfonso VI,
went down and besieged the ancient city of
Toledo (which had been in Moorish possession
four hundred years), taking it three years later.
It was never recovered by the Moors, and the
Moslems became alarmed at this signal instance
of Gothic bravery and effrontery, and
for a time ceased their dissensions. But, in
their alarm at the aggressions of the Christian
forces, they placed their necks within a yoke
of slavery far worse than would have been
forced upon them by the Goths. They conferred
together, and, realizing their own weakness,
sent over into Africa for assistance.
There then reigned in Morocco the fierce
Yussef, a fanatical Bedouin, who hated all
Arabs almost as much as he hated the “Christian
dogs.” But he hastened to the relief of
his fellow-Moslems with a great army of
fanatics as fierce and uncouth as himself. He
had hardly landed and learned of the fall of
Toledo, when he summoned King Alfonso
either to embrace the faith of Mohammed, consent
to pay tribute, or prepare for battle.
Flushed with his successes, Alfonso chose to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
fight, and the two great armies met in the
battle of Zallaca, in the month of October,
1086, when the Spanish army was utterly overthrown.
Yussef pursued his advantage vigorously,
and eventually all southern Spain was
subjected to him, including the city of Seville,
which was taken in 1091; and not only were
the Christians themselves the object of his
fury, but the Moslem chiefs who had sent
for him to come to their aid, who were all
either murdered or transported to Africa.
Thus was the Almoravid dynasty established,
with its capital at Cordova, and which
lasted until 1147. Yussef died about twenty
years later, leaving the kingdom to his son
Ali, and the Spanish Moslems were oppressed
by the Bedouin chiefs, who were as savage
and illiterate as the Ommiades were gentle
and refined. Cordova soon lost its libraries,
its schools and universities, and became a
place to be shunned, rather than sought, by
scholars and men of letters.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Gothic provinces, called
kingdoms (sometimes united, sometimes divided),
had not been blind to their advantage
in pressing the Moors on every side, and the
latter steadily, though slowly, shrank within
more restricted confines, until the Tagus and
the Guadiana were their most northern boundaries.
Grim Yussef died in 1104, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
great Alfonso in 1109. The latter, under
whom Castile had risen steadily to the first
rank among the kingdoms of the north, and
who was known as the “Buckler of the Faith,”
had been victor in thirty-nine battles, and
had but twice suffered defeat.</p>

<p>The year 1104 saw the crown of Aragon pass
to Alfonso I, who was married to a daughter
of Alfonso VI of Castile. It has been said
that if the two Alfonsos had but united their
forces, while holding their respective kingdoms,
the Moors might have been expelled
from Spain three hundred years sooner than
they were.</p>

<p>About this time rose to power in Morocco
a fanatical Moslem known as Mohammed ben
Abdullah, the son of a lamplighter in the
mosque of Cordova. He was educated in
Cordova and in Bagdad, but later went to
Morocco, where he made his home in the
Atlas Mountains and proclaimed himself the
Mahdi, or leader of the faithful. He soon had
many followers, who called themselves <i>Almohades</i>,
or followers of the one God. Raising
an immense army, Mohammed came down
from the mountains and besieged the city
of Morocco, which was defended by Ali the
son of Yussef. Both Ali and Mohammed
died during the siege, and one Abdelmummen
succeeded the Mahdi in command. He took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the city, driving out and killing the inhabitants,
and repeopling it with Bedouins from
the desert and the mountains.</p>

<p>Proclaimed sovereign of all Africa and
Moslem Spain, Abdelmummen invaded the
peninsula with an army so vast that two
months were consumed in crossing the straits,
and an alarm spread throughout all Europe;
but the men of the new sect were more anxious,
apparently, for converts to their creed than
victories over the Christians, for in the end
the Almoravides were either expelled or converted,
and the Almohades reigned supreme.
Their dominion extended from the Atlantic
to the Nile in Africa, and in Spain over all
that the Christian arms had not wrested from
their predecessors.</p>

<p>Abdelmummen died in 1162, leaving the
kingdom to his son Cid Yussef, who built the
mosque of Seville, the great aqueduct that
brought water to that city, and the bridge
across the Guadalquivir. He was killed in
1184 and his son Yacoub succeeded, who in
the year 1195 won a great victory over Alfonso
VIII, at the battle of Alarcos. A little
more than a century previously the Moslems
had gained another victory, at Zallaca; but
these two, vast as were their results, were to be
avenged by an overwhelming defeat which the
God of the Christians was preparing for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The chronicles of the eleventh century (to
turn back a moment) would not be complete
without mention of the doughty deeds of the
great Cid Campeador, who, like Count Fernan
Gonzalez, was descended from Nuño Rastro,
one of the first judges of Castile.</p>

<p>His real name was Rodrigo or Ruy Diaz,
and he was born at Bivar, near the city of
Burgos, about the year 1040, although so
much of myth envelops him that the exact
date of his birth is uncertain. At all events,
he was a Castilian of noble birth, who at an
early age commanded the forces of Sancho
II of Castile, when that ruler deprived his
brothers of their kingdoms of Leon and Galicia.
According to the numerous “Ballads of
the Cid,” which were written and sung as
early as the twelfth century, no hero of history
ever performed more valiant deeds than
he, though he can hardly be held up to the
world as a model of constancy and patriotism:
for he fought, first on the side of his native
Castile, then, becoming offended at a slight
put upon him by King Alfonso (though he had
led the army into Toledo), he went over to
the Emir of Saragossa and battled stoutly for
the Moors.</p>

<p>His first appearance seems to have been
as the avenger of his father’s death, when he
challenges his slayer, Count Lozeno, to mortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
combat, and leaves him dead on the field.
Then at the command of the king he marries
the count’s daughter, the lovely Ximena,
who has prayed her sovereign to avenge this
deed; and yet when Rodrigo proposes, she
consents to be his wife. The king argued,
with true kingly logic, that “he whose hand
had made her an orphan should of a right be
her protector”; but the ballads do not tell
us what Ximena thought about it. Still, they
inform us often that he was in every respect
a model husband, and that, more than all else
in the world, he loved his gallant steed Babieca,
his good sword Tizona, and his faithful
wife Ximena&mdash;probably the order named being
their rank in his affections.</p>

<p>Although he had fought against his king,
yet in his latter years he made amends, became
a terror to the Moors, and took the Moorish
province of Valencia in 1088, which he held
until his death in the year 1099. And, that
we may be sure his devoted wife was faithful
to the last, we are told that she held the city
of Valencia for two years after her husband
died, though surrounded by enemies, and
then carried his embalmed body to Burgos,
where for ten years it sat in state beside
the high altar of a convent church.</p>

<p>The empty tomb, to which the Cid was
borne upon his charger, and in which he and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
his wife rested for many years, may yet be
seen in the old convent of San Pedro de Cardena,
near to Burgos; and in that old Castilian
city, preserved in a glass case in the
town hall, are shown the veritable “bones of
the Cid and his wife Ximena.” Here also is
the “solar del Cid,” or the site of the house
he lived in, now indicated by three obelisks
of stone, which stand not far from a memorial
arch erected to Count Fernan Gonzalez.
And, moreover, in one of the cathedral cloisters
is still preserved an ancient iron-clasped
trunk, which belonged to the Cid, and which,
tradition states, he once filled with sand and
pledged to some wealthy Jews for an enormous
sum, as full of priceless jewels. It is
also stated, to his credit, that he afterward
redeemed his pledge and paid his debts in
full.</p>

<p>The renowned Cid Campeador may or
may not have performed all the valorous
feats ascribed to him, but it is certain that
Spain yet holds his name in grateful remembrance.
When his end drew nigh (knowing
that a battle was imminent), he ordered that
his corpse should be placed erect upon his
war horse, his sword in hand, and taken forth
to fight a last battle for his country:</p>


<p class="ppq4 p1">“‘Bring in my Babieca’&mdash;the Cid a-dying lay&mdash;</p>
<p class="pph4"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>‘That I may say farewell to him before I pass away.’</p>
<p class="pph4">The good horse, strong and gentle, full quiet did he keep,</p>
<p class="pph4">His large soft eyes dilating, as though he fain would weep.</p>
<p class="pph4">‘I am going, dear companion, thy master rides no more,</p>
<p class="pph4">Thou well deservest high reward, I leave thee this in store:</p>
<p class="pph4">Thy master’s deeds shall keep thy name until earth’s latest day;’</p>
<p class="pph4">And speaking not another word, the good Cid passed away.”</p>

<p class="p1">The ruined castle still stands, on a hill
above the city of Burgos, in which Don Garcia
was imprisoned in 958; where Alfonso
of Leon was confined by the Cid, and where
Edward I of England was married to Eleanor
of Castile.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">KINGS OF CASTILE AND ARAGON.</p>

<p class="p2">We have been hitherto tracing the course
of several streams which, rising in various
parts of Africa and Spain in the south and in
the north, yet have mingled their currents
somewhat; but we shall soon find that the
stream which had its source in the north
became eventually a resistless torrent that
swept all before it.</p>

<p>At or near the close of the twelfth century
we find three Alfonsos on as many
thrones: Alfonso VIII, surnamed the Noble,
in Castile; Alfonso IX in Leon and Oviedo;
and Alfonso II ruling in Portugal, which had
become separated from Spain in 1095. Navarre
was under Sancho VII, while Aragon
and the greater portion of Catalonia acknowledged
Pedro II. At the same time the Moslems
were governed by Mohammed abu Abdallah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the son of Yacoub, who had won the
great battle of Alarcos. These are names
merely, some of which have hardly survived,
in connection with great deeds, the lives of
those who bore them. But it was permitted
Alfonso VIII, in the year 1212, to inflict a
defeat upon the Moors from which they never
recovered. This was at the great battle of
Navas de Tolosa, when, according to the
statements of the victors, at least one hundred
thousand Moslems fell, victims to Christian
prowess, and, sad to relate, after the victory
was assured, objects of Christian bigotry;
for they treated with shameful barbarity those
who survived.</p>

<p>The battlefield of Tolosa was the turning
point of Moslem fortunes, for from the date of
that great event the followers of Mahommed
lost steadily in Spain, retreating ever nearer
the southern coast, whence their ancestors had
invaded the peninsula five hundred years before.</p>

<p>Alfonso the Noble survived this achievement
but two years, and died in 1214, leaving
a reputation not only as a great warrior, but
as a lover of learning, having established, it
is said, the first university in Spain in the
year 1209. He left his throne to his son
Henry I, and under the regency of his daughter
Berenguela, who, when Henry was accidentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
killed, secured the kingdom for her
own son Ferdinand. Two momentous events
came to pass at this time&mdash;the battle of Tolosa,
which drove back the Moslems, and the
union of the kingdoms of Castile and Leon
under one ruler; for at the death of Alfonso
IX of Leon the kingdom passed to Ferdinand
III, who was thus placed in possession
of resources and armies which he could unite
toward the expulsion of the Moors.</p>

<p>He was later canonized for his great services
to Christendom, and is known to history
as St. Ferdinand. It is a curious fact
that his cousin, Louis of France, son of his
mother’s sister, and likewise a grandson of
Alfonso VIII of Castile, was also canonized;
and the grandmother of both was Eleanor
of England, daughter of Henry II.</p>

<p>Well, St. Ferdinand, to call him by the
title bestowed upon him three hundred years
after his death, was a flaming sword as toward
the Moors. He captured their capital, Cordova,
in 1236, the city of Jaen in 1246, and at
last the “Queen of the Guadalquivir,” beautiful
Seville (ancient port of the Ph&oelig;nicians,
the Roman Hispalis), where he died in 1252,
and where his tomb and many precious relics
of his time may be seen in the great cathedral
there.</p>

<p>Almost equally renowned was Jayme I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the King of Aragon, who took the Balearic
Isles from the Moors in 1229, Valencia in
1237, the province of Murcia in 1266, and
who, before he died in 1276, had gained thirty
pitched battles with the enemy, and had
founded, some say, more than two thousand
Christian churches. But he has the credit of
having introduced into Spain the terrible Inquisition
(in 1232), and that goes far toward
counterbalancing his meritorious work for
the freedom of his country.</p>

<p>Alfonso X, called “the Wise,” because he
was more a scholar than soldier, succeeded
St. Ferdinand, and under him, it is recorded,
the Castilian became the national language.
Slowly but steadily the ancient Gothic had
been changing, and it was now in a sense
crystallized when Alfonso caused the Bible to
be translated into the Castilian, as well as
works on chemistry and philosophy, and wrote
a chronicle of Spain down to the time of
Ferdinand, his father and predecessor. The
“Fuero Juzgo, or Forum Judicum,” the ancient
Visigothic code of laws, which he translated
and codified, became the law of the
land and the model of yet existing laws in
Spain.</p>

<p>But, though quite learned, Alfonso was
not morally much in advance of his time, for
he caused his brother to be strangled, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
provoked a rebellion of his sons, by which he
was driven from his throne two years before
his death. His son, Sancho IV, who was as
vigorous as his father was feeble, drove the
Emir of Morocco back to Africa in 1291, and
after a short reign left the kingdom to his
son, Ferdinand IV, who, dying in 1312, was
succeeded by Alfonso XI of Castile. He was
the last of that name to sit on the throne
until Alfonso XII, father of the boy king of
our time, Alfonso XIII, after an interval of
five hundred and sixty years.</p>

<p>Ferdinand IV was an infant too young to
reign at the death of his father, but affairs of
the kingdom were ably managed by the queen
regent, his mother, and when he reached man’s
estate he nobly devoted himself to the great
work bequeathed him by his ancestors. Under
him the Castilian frontiers were extended
to Gibraltar, the fortress of which he took,
in the year 1302. But his reign was likewise
short, and at his death he left the kingdom to
an infant son, and the regency to his mother,
Maria, who a second time assumed the cares
of royalty without its remunerations.</p>

<p>Alfonso XI showed the lack of parental
guidance during youth by the errors of his
early manhood, among other indiscretions
forming an illegitimate alliance with a lady
who became the mother of Don Enrique of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Trastamara, who later slew his half-brother
Pedro “the Cruel.” By the great victory of
the Rio Salado, in 1340, Alfonso retrieved his
damaged reputation in the eyes of the people
and firmly established the kingdom upon an
impregnable basis. The combined hosts of
Spanish Moors and Africans had assembled
and laid siege to Tarifa, the southernmost
town in Spain. The Christian armies, under
the lead of Alfonso and the king of Portugal,
met and overthrew them near the plains of
Algeciras, inflicting such slaughter that the
dead lay piled in heaps, the slain, it was estimated,
amounting to two hundred thousand.</p>

<p>This was the last invasion from Africa,
which had been so prolific in barbarian and
semi-barbarian conquerors; and if any other
was in contemplation it was prevented the
following year, when Alfonso’s fleet destroyed
that of the Moors in the Straits of Gibraltar.
King Alfonso besieged the fortress of Gibraltar
itself&mdash;which had been in Moorish possession
since 1333&mdash;but failed to dislodge the
enemy, and it was not until more than a hundred
years later, in 1462, that it again fell into
the hands of the Spaniards. Alfonso doubtless
held the ambitious project of ridding the
peninsula entirely of the Moors; but his
country was not sufficiently united, and one
hundred and fifty years were to elapse before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the consummation of this object, under King
Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. That he was
a valiant warrior, despite his many failings,
is shown by his death in the field, while besieging
Gibraltar, when he fell a victim to
the terrible pestilence known as the “black
death,” in the year 1350.</p>

<p>His son and successor, Don Pedro of Castile,
is known to history as “Pedro the Cruel,”
which name well illustrates his character.
Cruel and licentious to a degree never before
shown in any occupant of the throne, Pedro
followed his father’s pernicious example, his
amour with Doña Maria de Padilla being
maintained while his lawful wife was a prisoner
by his command. Though for a time
popular with the masses, owing to his inclination
rather toward the people than the
nobility, his lust, covetousness, and cruelty
caused a revolt. He overcame his opponents,
but signalled his return to power by the
murder of his half-brother, Don Fadrique,
his mother, many of his relatives, and his
wife. It is charged against him that he cut
the throats of the Emir of Granada and fifty
of his nobles, while they were his guests
under a flag of truce, and committed other
atrocious deeds. His half-brother, Henry,
having escaped to France, returned with an
army, but Pedro appealed to the son of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
English Edward III, the “Black Prince,”
and that gallant adventurer, then fighting in
France, came to his assistance. By his aid
he discomfited his enemies, but his cruelty to
prisoners so disgusted his noble ally that he
retired and left him to his fate. Henry then
appeared with a small force, around which
the people eagerly gathered, and Pedro was
defeated and taken prisoner.</p>

<p>The last act of this terrible drama took
place in a tent where the half-brothers, sons
of the same father, met in deadly combat,
which ended by Pedro’s being stabbed in the
back, and pouring out his life-blood at the
fratricide’s feet. Thus were the sins of Alfonso
XI quickly visited upon his children,
and the kingdom which he had founded threatened
with disruption.</p>

<p>Pedro the Cruel was killed in 1369, and
as Henry II his half-brother, the regicide,
assumed his place, claimants arose to contest
his dubious title to the throne, and
among them John of Gaunt, the English
Duke of Lancaster, Pedro’s son-in-law. At
the same time, as enemies, he could count the
Kings of Moorish Granada, Aragon, and Navarre.
But he defeated the machinations of
all these opponents and eventually reduced
the kingdom to a state of peace, in which it
continued till his death, in 1379, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
occasioned by a pair of poisoned boots, sent
him as a present by the treacherous Emir of
Granada.</p>

<p>His son, John I, reigned eleven years, or
from 1379 to 1390, though in 1385 the Duke
of Lancaster, John of Gaunt, assumed the
title of king, with the arms of Castile, Leon,
and France. He was, however, dissuaded by
the promise that his daughter Catherine
(whose mother was Constance, daughter of
Pedro the Cruel and Maria de Padilla) should
marry Henry III, who succeeded to the throne
of Castile in 1390, and reigned until 1406.
The heir of this union was John II, who was
King of Castile from 1406 to 1454, and whose
chief claim to distinction is as the father of
Isabella, who, after her brother, Henry IV,
had died, in 1474, became Queen of Castile.
Thus in the veins of the woman who was to
become the greatest of her line ran the blood,
not only of Pedro the Cruel, but of his bastard
brother, Henry of Trastamare.</p>

<p>But the resultant issue of her marriage
with Ferdinand of Aragon, in 1469, was to be
yet more deeply tinctured with the blood of
the regicide; for the son of Henry of Trastamare
had married a daughter of Pedro of
Aragon, who was almost as cruel and implacable
as Pedro of Castile. Ferdinand, son of
John I, and grandson of Henry, became King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of Aragon, and was succeeded by his son, John
II of Aragon, through whom at his death
the throne passed to Ferdinand, later called
the Catholic, and who became the royal consort
of Isabella.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">FERDINAND AND ISABELLA.</p>

<p class="p2">What had hitherto been the curse of Spain,
its intestinal divisions, feuds, rival projects of
petty kings, was soon to be removed by the
union of Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of
Aragon, whose marriage took place October
19, 1469. Isabella was eighteen years of age,
Ferdinand only seventeen; but their training
had been such that their intelligence and deportment
were in advance of their years.
They were cousins and lovers. Isabella was
a blonde, with blue eyes and chestnut hair, a
small but symmetrical figure, graceful and
modest of carriage, intellectual, devout,
charming, but not handsome. Ferdinand was
tall and manly, a fine horseman, courteous,
chivalrous, like his wife of the fair, Gothic
type, eloquent of speech, with elegant bearing
and polished manners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>These were the two who for thirty years
were to reign together, who were to unite the
dismembered fragments of war-harried Spain,
who were to establish a throne that was to
command the respect of all Europe, a kingdom
whose influence was to extend around
the world. And yet, if the historians are to
be credited, they were so poor at the time of
their betrothal that they were compelled to
borrow money for their wedding. Fortunately,
their credit was good, for, despite their poverty,
it was known to all that they had great
expectations. But their enemies pressed
them hard, and it was only by stealing off in
disguise, with a few attendants merely as
company, that Ferdinand was able to reach
Valladolid, where Isabella was awaiting him,
and claim his bride.</p>

<p>Five years later, in 1474, Isabella’s brother
Enrique, the last male of the house of Trastamare,
passed away, and his sister succeeded
to the throne of Castile, to which she was already
entitled. In the ancient city of Segovia,
with attendant pomp and ceremony, on
the 13th of December, 1474, the heralds
proclaimed her Queen of Castile. But her
claim was disputed, and there ensued the “war
of succession,” only ended by the defeat of
the Portuguese at the battle of Toro, after
which peace was concluded, with France and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Portugal, in 1479. That same year, by the
death of his father, John II, Ferdinand succeeded
to Aragon and its dependencies, and
thus the twain found themselves virtual rulers
of the best part of Spain.</p>

<p>With the exception of Navarre, which went
to Eleanor, Ferdinand’s half-sister, and of the
kingdom of Granada, still held by the Moors,
united Castile and Aragon may be said to
have included all Spain, from the Atlantic
east to the Mediterranean, and from the
Pyrenees on the north to the Straits of Gibraltar
on the south, though each kingdom
was independent. By the exercise of consummate
skill, patience, and persistence, both
in the field of war and in diplomacy, the entire
peninsula, with the exception of Portugal,
eventually was welded into one kingdom, and
the various armies that had so frequently
clashed in conflict were placed under one
supreme command. This was not accomplished
until after many years, but almost
from the first these two wise sovereigns bent
all their energies to the consummation of
their purpose: Isabella in the domestic administration,
Ferdinand in war and diplomacy,
which was to unite Spain and expel the hated
infidel.</p>

<p>We will not now pause to inquire their
motives, but note only the vastness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
undertaking. More than any other nation,
perhaps, the Spanish were divided, one section
speaking a French dialect, another the
Basque; one province might be aristocratic,
another monarchical, and yet another democratic,
while every one had its own peculiar
laws and rights, called “<i>fueros</i>.” To show
the feeling of independence which pervaded
Aragon, for instance, we may quote the ancient
formula used in seating a king on the throne:
“We, each of whom is as good as you, and
who altogether are more powerful, make you
our king as long as you shall keep our <i>fueros</i>;
otherwise not.”</p>

<p>These <i>fueros</i> were charters of privileges,
which had been granted by former kings,
lords, or counts to the inhabitants of certain
towns, particularly to those which were, or at
one time had been, on the exposed frontiers,
deserted by or recaptured from the Moors.
The occasion had long since passed for the
granting of these privileges, but the people
still clung to them, jealously guarding against
their infringement or revocation. In some
provinces, as in the Basque region, the <i>fueros</i>
rendered the inhabitants almost immune from
service to the king or queen, free from national
taxes, not liable for soldiers to serve beyond
their own frontiers, etc. The first of the
<i>fueros</i> was granted as early as 1020, and seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to have been that of Leon. Then there was
the <i>Cortes</i>, or popular assemblage of representatives
from all over the kingdom, the first of
Castile, consisting of a deputy from each city,
having met in 1169.</p>

<p>Again, there was the Church to reckon
with, for it was now established on a sure
foundation, and the primacy of Spain, with
its archbishopric at Toledo, was considered
second only to the papacy in its influence and
revenues. As Isabella was devout by nature,
and as Ferdinand was politic, they allied
themselves with the Church from the first,
and though themselves swayed by its servants,
made it the means toward an ultimate end,
which was the consolidation of their empire
and the subjugation of the people.</p>

<p>We have seen already that one of the
forces in Spain ever acting against united
effort for the expulsion of the Moors was the
independence of the nobility. Castile itself
derived its name from the number of its castles,
mainly belonging to independent nobles, rich
and warlike, possessed of vast estates, not
subject to taxation or imprisonment&mdash;in fact
little kings, some of them at the outset almost
as powerful as their sovereigns themselves.
These were the <i>ricos hombres</i>, who held most of
the lucrative offices; next to them ranked the
<i>hidalgos</i> and <i>caballeros</i> (<i>Hijo de algo</i>, son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
somebody, and <i>caballero</i>, a horseman, knight,
cavalier, nobleman), who comprised the floating
population of warriors or free lances,
ready for a fight at a moment’s notice, and
always spoiling for a tilt with the enemy.</p>

<p>These were all dealt with in due course, in
one manner or another, until all were more
or less firmly attached to the crown and
pledged to its support. The manner in which
the sovereigns attached to their service the
three great military orders of Calatrava, Santiago,
and Alcantara well illustrates the subtlety
of Isabella and the craft of Ferdinand.
These orders were founded after the models
of the Hospitalers and the Templars during
the Crusades; but while originally intended
for warfare against the Moors, they had become
possessed of vast wealth and influence
during the three hundred years of their existence.
They were, in fact, through their
strength, their capacity to send thousands of
armed cavaliers into the field, and their absolute
independence, a possible menace to the
crown; so, when it happened that a vacancy
occurred in the grand mastership of Santiago,
in 1476, the queen by intrigue secured it for
Ferdinand. Eleven years later he secured
that of Calatrava, and in 1494, the last of
all, the grand mastership of Alcantara. Thus
were the most powerful of the independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
military organizations secured and held in
fealty to the crown. Though it required
eighteen years to accomplish this, yet eventually
it was brought about&mdash;an exhibition of
persistence and craft which throws a flood
of light upon the doings and aims of these
astute rulers over regenerated Spain.</p>

<p>The unarmed and undisciplined masses
were of little account, in the scheme of reconquest
planned by Ferdinand and Isabella.
But the upper classes, with their immense
wealth and privileges, with their castles,
princely domains, and armed retainers&mdash;these
were the first objects aimed at by the sovereigns,
when they were forging the weapons
and welding the nation together, preliminary
to their onslaught upon the Moors. Isabella,
as early as 1476, revived the association of
common people which had once risen against
the nobles, two hundred years before, called
the <i>Hermandad</i>, or Brotherhood, composed
mainly of people of the middle class, who
acted as police and detectors of crime, and in
the end became powerful enough to prove
an effectual check upon the arrogance of the
feudal lords. When, however, the sovereigns
found themselves possessed of a strong standing
army, with servile soldiers to do their bidding,
the <i>Hermandad</i> was disbanded; having
served as a means to an end, it passed away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>It was during the reign of Ferdinand and
Isabella, and early in their reign, that another
factor tending to the consolidation of their
power was availed of, in the establishment of
the “Holy Office” of the Inquisition. That
terrible tribunal, with its spies working in secret,
its judges shielded from public view, its
proceedings veiled in secrecy, was revived in
Spain and presided over, by the infamous Tomas
de Torquemada, as inquisitor general, who
was prior of a Dominican monastery at Segovia.
Yielding to his pleadings, Isabella consented
to apply to the Pope for permission to
use the institution as a means of weeding out
heresy from among the Jews and Moors in
her dominions. In an evil day for Spain, and
to the discredit of the humanity of those days,
this queen&mdash;who has received the praise of
generations for her eminent wisdom, modesty,
generosity, maternal tenderness, discretion,
moderation&mdash;not only gave her consent, but
did all in her power, to bring to the flames
thousands of her subjects, whose only offence
was that they differed from her on points of
religious belief!</p>

<p>During the remaining years of Torquemada’s
life, or from 1483 to 1498, it is estimated
that eight or nine thousand “heretics”
were burned to death at the stake. And he
was but one, the first, of a line of Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
“inquisitors,” who inflicted upon others of his
race, made in God’s image, entitled to compassion,
the most fiendish tortures it was
possible for man to conceive. We can not
forget nor ignore the terrible truth that it
was by the express sanction of Isabella, as
well as through her connivance, that this
monstrosity reared its hideous head in her
kingdom, and devoured her loyal subjects.
In her day was inaugurated that barbarous
“solemnity” called the “<i>auto da fé</i>,” edict of
the Inquisition, when the heretics ferreted
out by the familiars of the Holy Office were
marched through the principal streets of her
capital, clad in robes covered with hellish
emblems, flames and devils, and followed by
processions of priests and monks to the great
square, where they were burned at the stake;
consumed by flames which even royalty considered
it an honour to light and a pleasure to
gaze upon!</p>

<p>Ferdinand, of course, was an accessory;
he even forced the Inquisition upon the Aragonese,
who rebelled against it; but to him
have never been imputed the high and honourable
qualities ascribed to the “gentle” Isabella.
This, the darkest, foulest blot upon
her escutcheon&mdash;which neither the plea of
the exigencies of the time, nor that equally
puerile argument that she lived when ideas of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
morality and human brotherhood were crude,
will avail to remove&mdash;will stand against her
forever, an ineffaceable witness to the innate
cruelty and bigotry of this descendant of
Pedro the Cruel and Henry of Trastamare,
fratricides both, and one a regicide!</p>

<p>But the country prospered awhile&mdash;that
is, the kingdom gained in material wealth&mdash;chiefly,
however, from the confiscated properties
of the expelled heretics. During the thirty
years between the accession of Isabella and
her death&mdash;1474 to 1504&mdash;the royal revenues
increased more than thirtyfold. After the
discoveries in America the sovereigns were
compelled to establish five great councils to
manage affairs, the most important of which
was the Council of the Indies, with its headquarters
at Seville; but, notwithstanding, all
power was more and more centralized, until
after the death of Ferdinand and the accession
of Charles I.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">HOW THE MOORS WERE SUBJUGATED.</p>

<p class="p2">The Castilian court was established at
Cordova, where Isabella and Ferdinand received
the swarms of courtiers and noble
knights with brilliant retinues, as well as
foreign ambassadors, who swarmed hither to
do homage to the Spanish sovereigns. And,
though Christian and Moslem were still at
enmity, the turbaned Arab, the warlike Saracen,
with scimitar at his side, might be seen
among the assembled thousands in the busy
streets of Cordova. For, although an eternal
barrier existed between these two peoples in
their respective religions, and mutual hatred
may have smouldered in their bosoms, yet
they met and freely mingled, even intermarried,
exchanged courtesies and compliments,
and engaged in friendly jousts and tourneys.</p>

<p>But the time came when this strained condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of affairs was suddenly changed, about
the year 1478. The Moorish dominions, which
once extended practically over all Spain, were
now reduced to a single great province, or
kingdom, that of Granada. Yet it was a fertile
and populous province, comprising the
best and most beautiful lands in the peninsula,
with deep and rich valleys hidden among
forest-clad mountains, the peaks of some of
which reached the clouds and were covered
with perpetual snows. The capital of this
kingdom was founded by the Moors soon after
their first arrival from Africa, in the eighth
century, near the remains of a Roman town
called Illiberis. It had grown in wealth and
population, until, at the time of which we
speak, it probably contained 400,000 inhabitants,
and was surrounded by massive walls
fortified with numerous towers.</p>

<p>Granada the capital consisted of two cities
within one line of fortifications, the portion
known as the <i>Albaicin</i>, perched on a hill, and
containing the marts and dwellings of the
common people, and the hill of the Alhambra,
separated from the Albaicin by a deep gorge
through which flows the river Darro. Here,
about the year 1248, the founder of the Granadan
dynasty, Ibn Alhamar, began to build
that glorious palace, the Alhambra, which was
completed by his grandson, Mohammed III,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
seventy years later. Within the surrounding
walls defended by ninety towers the king held
court, with a retinue that constituted the
nucleus of a small town in itself. The founder
of the Alhambra assembled here artists and
artisans from every part of the Moslem world:
from Damascus and Bagdad, Cairo and Morocco;
and their genius here evolved one of the
most beautiful structures ever created by man.
Who has not read of the beautiful Alhambra,
with its pillared corridors, its assemblage of
marble and alabaster columns, its halls and
<i>patios</i> refreshed by plashing fountains, its
cornices mazes of arabesques, its latticed
windows, iridescent tiles, perfumed courts
and gardens; and above all, its peerless situation,
overlooking Granada, the Darro, the
vast meadows of the <i>vega</i>, and with a background
of cloud-capped, snow-crested mountains,
shining in the sun?</p>

<p>More than two centuries had passed since
Ibn Alhamar intrenched himself within the
Alhambra walls, and purchased exemption
from Christian assaults by the payment of
tribute. It was just before the capture of
Seville by Ferdinand the Saint that he bound
himself and his people to serve the Christians
as vassals, and, in consideration that his rich
territory should be undisturbed, pay an annual
tribute of two thousand <i>doblas</i> of gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and sixteen hundred Christian captives, or the
same number of Moors to serve as slaves.
Less than three hundred years before (as we
may recall) it was the Christians who paid
tribute, and in the halls of the <i>Alcázar</i>, at Seville,
were assembled the Christian maidens,
shamelessly given over to the rapacious
Moors. Now, however, the tide had turned,
and the founder of the last Moslem dynasty
on Spanish soil was glad to avert the possible
loss of his kingdom by surrendering a tithe of
his possessions to the Christians. Still, each
ruler maintained his armies, and a state of
armed neutrality existed.</p>

<p>Two centuries of comparative peace had
broadened and strengthened the Moorish
kingdom until it embraced a portion of south-eastern
Spain estimated as containing more
than eleven thousand square miles, with a
population of three millions, including one
hundred thousand valiant men of war. The
natural resources of the country were enhanced
by irrigation, at which the Orientals
are so expert, canals and aqueducts supplied
the cities and plains with water, and
trade with Africa, and with the Christians
of Spain, brought great wealth into the
kingdom.</p>

<p>The King of Granada, at the time the
marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella united the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
thrones of Aragon and Castile, was one
Muley Aben Hassan, a descendant in direct
line of the founder of the Alhambra, and
when he succeeded his father, Ismael, he
found himself ruler over no less than fourteen
fortified cities and nearly one hundred
towns, as well as many castled hamlets and
villages. This fierce warrior, taking account
of his vast possessions, refused longer to pay
tribute to the Castilian sovereigns, and in the
year 1478 a noble knight, Don Juan de Vara,
was sent to Granada to demand it. He was
admitted, with his retinue of cavaliers, and
found King Muley Hassan seated on his royal
divan, within the Alhambra, in the spacious
Hall of the Ambassadors. He was received
with courtesy, but when he named his errand
Muley Hassan haughtily replied: “Tell your
sovereigns that the Kings of Granada who
used to pay tribute in money to the Castilian
crown are dead! Our mint at present coins
nothing but blades of scimitars and heads of
lances!”</p>

<p>Now, the name of Granada signifies in
Arabic a pomegranate; and when King Ferdinand
received this insolent answer from
the Moor he quietly replied, “It is well; I
will pluck the seeds from this pomegranate,
one by one!” and he began preparations
for reducing the Moorish strongholds. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
he was not to strike the first blow, for the
old King of Granada, confident in the wealth
of his provinces and the strength of his
defences, and urged on by his fiery soldiery,
led an army against an isolated frontier post
of the Christians called Zahara. It was naturally
so strong, being perched upon a craggy
crest of a mountain, that its garrison neglected
to keep watch, and, one dark and
stormy night, was surprised and put to the
sword. The wretched captives taken in the
town below were driven like cattle to Granada;
and thus in the year 1481 the gauntlet
of war was thrown down by Muley Hassan,
King of the Moors.</p>

<p>King Ferdinand was willing enough to
take it up; in truth, had the Moors not taken
the initiative, war would have eventuated just
the same, for the one darling project of the
Christian sovereigns was the expulsion of the
Arabs from the country. But yet again the
Christian king was forestalled, though this
time it was by one of his own cavaliers. The
valiant Marquis of Cadiz, Roderigo Ponce de
Leon, who owned vast estates in Andalusia,
and could assemble a small army of his own
retainers, resolved to avenge Zahara and
strike a terrible blow at the Moors. Informed
by his spies that the Moorish town and
castle of Alhama, in the mountains of Granada,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
were but carelessly defended, he gathered
together a small force of cavalry and
foot soldiers, and, surprising the garrison
and scaling the walls, took both castle and
town by storm.</p>

<p>Alhama was known as the “Key of Granada,”
and was not many miles distant from
the capital itself; it also was the richest town
of the kingdom, and the Marquis of Cadiz
and his soldiers secured a vast amount of
booty, besides taking many captives. But
their position was now perilous in the extreme,
for when Muley Hassan learned the
news he raged like a tiger and immediately
set forth to retake Alhama with an army of
fiercest warriors. The sufferings of the Spanish
soldiers were intense, for they were cut
off from water, attacked on every side, and
allowed no rest; but succour came to them
from an unexpected source. The Duke of
Medina Sidonia&mdash;like the Marquis of Cadiz,
owner of vast possessions and lord over an
army of dependants, although an hereditary
foe of the latter&mdash;collected a large force and
hastened to the assistance of his beleaguered
brethren. King Ferdinand also turned toward
the scene of war; but, outstripped by
the Duke of Medina Sidonia, halted on the
way at Antiquera, and there began the assembling
of an army, to follow up the advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
so unexpectedly gained by his ardent
knights and soldiers.</p>

<p>Thus the immediate effect of this daring
assault and reprisal was the joining together
in friendly rivalry of two powerful lords who
had hitherto been at enmity, and the union of
many other rivals in arms, so that Ferdinand
soon found himself in command of forces sufficient
for the accomplishment of his long-cherished
designs against the Moors.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there were strife and dissension
in the capital city of Granada. The ill-timed
assault upon Zahara was deprecated by
the Moors, even before their loss of Alhama,
and eventually King Muley was driven from
the city during a revolt headed by his own
son, Boabdil el Chico.</p>

<p>The grief and indignation of the Moorish
populace of Granada are depicted in a popular
Spanish poem, with its sad refrain, “<i>Ay
de mí, Alhama!</i>” and which Lord Byron rendered
into English verse, beginning:</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“The Moorish king rides up and down</p>
<p class="ppn4">Through Granada’s royal town;<br />
From Elvira’s gates to those<br />
Of Vivarambla on he goes.</p>
<p class="ppn10">Woe is me, Alhama!</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“Letters to the monarch tell</p>
<p class="ppn4">How Alhama’s city fell;<br />
In the fire the scroll he threw,<br />
And the messenger he slew.</p>
<p class="ppn10">Woe is me, Alhama!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The aged Muley Hassan was expelled, but
he returned a few weeks later, and, gaining the
Alhambra, made the fountains and corridors
run with human blood in his endeavours to
regain his crown. But in vain: Boabdil el
Chico was then King of Granada, and it was
foreordained that his weakness should be the
cause of its downfall; for, in an assault he
later made upon a Christian castle, he was
taken prisoner and only released after promising
to hold himself a vassal to King Ferdinand.
Meanwhile the contest spread over a
widening territory, until all the kingdom was
aflame with war.</p>

<p>King Muley Hassan, who had retreated
to the port of Malaga, made a raid into the
dominions of the Duke of Medina Sidonia, in
revenge for the part the latter had taken at
Alhama, and regained his stronghold with
vast plunder. An incident of this raid shows
a romantic trait of Moorish as well as Spanish
character. Old Muley asked some captive
Christians what were the revenues of
his opponent, Don Pedro de Vargas, captain
of the castle of Gibraltar, whose territory he
was then invading. They answered that he
was entitled to an ox out of every drove of
cattle that crossed his boundaries. “Then,”
said the gallant old Moor, “Allah forbid that
so brave a cavalier should be defrauded of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
his dues,” and he selected twelve of the finest
cattle and sent them to Don Pedro with his
compliments. The latter, surprised and
touched by this display of gallantry, reciprocated
by sending Muley Hassan a scarlet
mantle and a costly vest of silk, with his
regrets that he had not been able to meet
him personally in the field!</p>

<p>Stung by this successful raid of the Moors
into the heart of Christian territory, some
cavaliers, headed by the Marquis of Cadiz
and Don Alonzo de Aguilar, made a foray
into the mountains of Malaga, expecting to
take and sack several wealthy towns. But
they were ambuscaded by a Moorish army
under the veteran Zagal, of Malaga, and not
only vanquished, but nearly exterminated, a
miserable remnant only escaping to Antiquera,
on the borders of Granada. In the
meantime a siege of the wealthy city of Loxa,
which lies not far from Granada, was abandoned
by King Ferdinand on account of the
superior tactics of another Moorish veteran,
Ali Atar, father-in-law of Boabdil the king,
and more than ninety years of age. He, too,
led the Spaniards into an ambuscade, and then
set upon them with such vigour that their
camp was captured and many Christians slain.</p>

<p>So the demon of war stalked up and down
the land, with victory first with Spaniard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
then with Moor. Still, all the time the Spanish
forces were augmenting, their territory
being steadily extended by the capture of
one stronghold after another, until, when
King Ferdinand again sat down before the
city of Loxa with a vast army, well equipped
with cannon and foreign auxiliaries, he could
count up more than seventy places that had
fallen before the assaults of his soldiers.
Among these were Coin and Cartama, and the
almost inaccessible castle of Ronda, on the
crest of the mountain of that name. Loxa
(pronounced Lo´ha) finally fell, and then the
victors were within thirty miles of the capital,
Granada, against which Ferdinand’s forces
were impatient to be led.</p>

<p>But though the ill-fated Boabdil, King of
Granada&mdash;who had violated his pledge of
vassalage to Ferdinand, and had hastened to
the defence of the city&mdash;was among the captives,
and though later the Castilians captured
the important towns and castles of Illora and
Moclin, within ten or twelve miles of Granada,
yet the army was temporarily withdrawn.
Ferdinand ravaged the <i>vega</i>, or plain of Granada,
up to the very gates of the capital; but
he was at that time unprepared to attempt its
capture or siege, and so retired with his army
to Cordova, whence he had set forth in May
of that year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The next year (1487), early in the spring,
a mighty army might have been seen leaving
Cordova, composed of twenty thousand horse
and fifty thousand foot. Its destination was
Malaga, the Mediterranean seaport, sometimes
called the “hand and mouth of Granada”;
for it was the outlet of the province, through
which its trade was conducted, and also
through which assistance came from the Moslems
in Africa. Isabella and Ferdinand had
received information that the Oriental infidels
in Turkey and Egypt were preparing to make
a landing here, and come with a vast army
to the assistance of the last of their faith in
Spain. So it was excellent strategy to first
dispose of this opulent seaport, with its towers
of defence, its large and hostile population,
and adjacent tributary country, before marching
upon the capital. The siege of Malaga
was prolonged many months by the valour of
its defenders. In the grim old tower above
the city, the ruins of which may still be seen,
a grizzled warrior, Hamet el Zegri, held out
the longest, with a handful of warriors who
had already tasted Christian blood at Ronda
and other places; but finally he too was
obliged to capitulate, and was cast into a
dungeon.</p>

<p>From the ransoms of the Moors of Malaga
Ferdinand probably derived a larger amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
than the Romans received from the Carthaginians,
fourteen hundred and eighty years before.
Many unfortunates, who could not pay
the extortionate sums demanded, were carried
off into slavery, to the number of more than
ten thousand.</p>

<p>The cities of Guadix and Baza suffered in
their turn the fate of Malaga, and at last Almeria,
the final refuge of that brave, fierce
son of Africa, El Zagal, an uncle of Boabdil,
and yet his bitterest enemy. With his surrender
the last of Granada’s outlying provinces
also fell into the hands of the enemy, and
the old warrior went over into Africa, where
he was imprisoned by the King of Fez and
ended his life in poverty.</p>

<p>During the ensuing winter Ferdinand was
busy with preparations for the final attack
upon the capital. He had, in truth, plucked
out nearly all the “seeds” of Granada, “the
pomegranate”; the time was now ripe for
finishing the fruit. In his acknowledgment
of vassalage, Boabdil had stipulated that,
should the chances of war give to the Christians
the cities of Baza, Guadix, and Almeria,
he would surrender Granada itself, accepting
other and inferior towns in exchange. But
when the demand came for his compliance,
he at first hesitated, then shut himself up
within the city and bade the king defiance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>So it was, in April, 1491, that the Spanish
army, fifty thousand strong, again appeared
in the <i>vega</i> of Granada, and was soon encamped
so near the city walls that the soldiers
could hear the cries of the <i>muezzins</i>, as they
sent forth the Moslem calls to prayer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">THE FALL OF GRANADA.</p>

<p class="p2">Granada, the last stronghold of the Moors
in Spain, capital city of the delightful Andalusia,
since called by the Spaniards “the
Land of the most Holy Virgin,” was finally
invested by the Castilian host. In vain flashed
signal fires from the <i>atalayas</i> on surrounding
hills; no friendly succour could now reach
the beleaguered city, either from the coast,
from the mountains, or from Africa. It lay
like an Oriental gem, a “diamond in an emerald
setting” with the green vega outspread
at its feet, embossed with olive groves, glistening
with silver streams, and with a background
of rugged mountains flashing the sun
and reflecting the moonlight from their snow-clad
summits.</p>

<p>In this beautiful city the Moors had lived
two hundred and fifty years. Its downfall was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
hastened by the rivalry of two tribes or factions
among the Moors themselves. Those
of the tribe of the Abencerrages were the most
noble and humane, the most favourably disposed
toward the Spaniards, and are said to
have been descended from the ancient kings
of Arabia. But the fierce Zegris, their rivals,
were of African blood, hated the Christians
intensely, and retained to the last all the
savage traits of the desert Bedouins. Not
many years before the advent of the Christians
into the vega, the Zegris had massacred
the Abencerrages, beheaded the flower of
their noble warriors, and the fountain basin
of the Alhambra hall which still retains their
name was filled with their blood.</p>

<p>The Zegris had conquered, but in their
endeavours to overcome their domestic enemies
they had so weakened their own forces
that the final triumph of their hated Christian
foes was the more easily assured. Ferdinand
and his army came in the blossoming springtime,
when the glorious vega was spangled
with flowers and all Nature joyous. “He will
stay through the summer, and in the autumn,
as the winter rains come on, will go away,”
said the Moors. “If we can hold out till
winter, we can at least survive another year.
Perhaps help will then arrive from Africa or
from the East<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>But the spring faded into summer and
through the long, hot months the Castilian
army lay intrenched; autumn came, and still
no signs of departure; instead, in place of
the city of tents, with which the plain had
been flecked and whitened, arose the stone
city of Santa Fé, which exists in our time, and
which may be seen to-day, covering the site
of the Christian camp.</p>

<p>Then the Moors despaired of succour indeed,
for hitherto it had been Ferdinand’s custom
to retire to his capital for the winter
season, and campaign in summer only. The
Moors had planted no crops, reaped no harvests,
and now gaunt famine was staring them
in the face; the <i>cavalgadas</i> of supplies, sent
to them by friendly chiefs, were captured by
the watchful Christians, and their condition
was most pitiable. Still, the siege had not
been without its incidents of startling character,
its display of chivalrous deeds of high
renown; for, after the arrival of Isabella at
the camp, the spirited cavaliers vied with each
other as to which should perform the most
daring deed, until, the Moors usually getting
the best of those individual encounters, Ferdinand
forbade them.</p>

<p>However, you may see, high up between
the towers of the church subsequently erected
at Santa Fé, the marble effigy of a Moor’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
head, which reminds us of the most notable
of those encounters. One of the most defiant
and insolent of the Moorish cavaliers was
Yarfe the Moslem, who carried his insolence
so far as one day to dash into the Spanish
camp and throw his spear into the tent of the
queen. To offset this reckless deed, one of
the Spanish <i>caballeros</i>, seeing the gate of Granada
one day but negligently guarded, passed
the sentinels and rode into the city, right
up to the door of the great mosque, against
which, with the point of his poniard, he affixed
a piece of wood, with “<i>Ave Maria</i>” printed
on it. Then he wheeled about and clattered
down the street, now thronging with astonished
and angered Moors, and miraculously escaped,
hurling cries of defiance at his enemies as he
passed through the gate.</p>

<p>When the Moslems found the Christian
emblem fastened to the door of their sacred
mosque, they were beside themselves with
rage, and the next day gigantic Yarfe attached
the bit of wood to the tail of his horse
and paraded with it, dragging in the dust,
before the Spanish army. This insult was
not to be borne, and as he defied any one of
the cavaliers to meet him in single combat,
Ferdinand was overwhelmed with petitions
for permission to engage him. He reluctantly
gave consent to a fiery young Castilian, Garcilasso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
de la Vega, who, after kneeling at the
feet of his beloved queen, armed himself completely
and sallied forth to fight the Moor.
His foe treated him at first with contempt,
being almost twice his size and more finely
mounted; but what Garcilasso lacked in
stature he made up in spirit, and in the sight
of the Christian army, and of the Moslems
gathered on the battlements, he slew the infidel
after a terrible combat, cut off his head,
and took it to the tent of Isabella.</p>

<p>The site of this encounter is marked to-day
with a large stone cross covered with a canopy,
and between the church towers of Santa Fé
still rests the marble head of Yarfe the Moor.
Across the vega, at Zubia, stand several great
stone crosses, also to commemorate the narrow
escape of the queen, one day, from capture
by the Moors. Yet another reminder of that
memorable siege of Granada is the commemorative
chapel on the bank of the river Xenil,
which indicates the spot where Boabdil el
Chico surrendered the keys of the capital;
for at last, as we know, Granada capitulated,
to famine rather than assault, to overwhelming
numbers rather than to superior feats of
arms.</p>

<p>On the 2d of January, 1492, the Moorish
king came down from the fortified palace
on the Alhambra hill with a small retinue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and met the Castilian sovereigns on the right
bank of the Xenil. “El Rey Chico”&mdash;the
Little King&mdash;gave up what his fiercer ancestors,
and particularly his own father, would
have fought to defend till the last gasp. His
real power had departed; the emblems of it
he handed to Ferdinand, saying: “These keys,
O king, are thine, since Allah hath decreed
it: use thy success with clemency and thy
power with moderation.” The exit of the
“Little King” was more dramatic than his
action on the stage of war; yet he went not
out as a warrior, but as a woman. Within
sight of the battlements of Granada is a gap in
the hills which surround the plain, and here
it is related Boabdil paused to look his last
on the fair city he had so ignominiously abandoned,
and wept at the remembrance of his
misfortunes. And his mother reproached him
with&mdash;“You do well to weep, like a woman,
for what you could not defend like a man!”
The scene of this incident is still known as
“<i>El último suspiro del Moro</i>,” or “The last sigh
of the Moor.”</p>

<p>But it was not his last sigh by any means,
for he lived for years thereafter: lived to see
the dismemberment of his empire, the scattering
of his people, and finally to die in a foreign
land, in the service of the King of Morocco.
In the capitulation it was stipulated that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Boabdil and his subjects should do homage
to the Castilian sovereigns, that they should
be protected in their religious exercises, be
governed by their own <i>cadis</i>, be exempt from
tribute for three years, and within that period
all who wished to emigrate to Africa should
be furnished with free transportation thither.
Boabdil was granted lands in the Alpuxarras
Mountains, and at first lived peacefully in a
secluded valley; but eventually, through the
treachery or mistaken zeal of his vizier, he
parted with his possessions in Spain for a sum
of money, and went over to Africa, where
travellers may see what is alleged to be his
tomb, in the city of Tlemcen in Algiers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">A MEMORABLE REIGN.</p>

<p class="p2">The reign of Ferdinand and Isabella has
been called the most celebrated, and the year
1492 the most eventful, in Spanish history.
Not the fall of Granada alone made that year
notable; not the culmination of a long series
of wars, extending through centuries, and conducing
to the final triumph of Christian arms,
made the year 1492 memorable&mdash;for the youth
of this age scarcely need be told that it was,
in a sense, the birth year of America!</p>

<p>A sad and preoccupied witness of the
Christian triumph at Granada, one who saw
the tumultuous entrance into the Alhambra
of the Spanish army, the unfurling of the Castilian
banner on the tower of <i>La Vela</i>, the
departure of the broken-hearted Moors&mdash;one
Christopher Columbus was attendant through
it all. Possessed with his grand idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
reaching the Indies by sailing directly westward&mdash;a
thing hitherto unheard of, at least
unattempted&mdash;after his rebuffs at the court
of Portugal he had come to Spain as early as
the year 1482, and was sent by the Duke of
Medina Celi to Isabella at Cordova. He followed
her court to Salamanca in 1486, there
had audience with the queen, and the next
year appeared before the famous Council in
the Dominican convent. Nothing came of
that except discouragement; but he returned
to Cordova the same year, whence he was
summoned by Isabella to the military camp
at Malaga. We have no continuous itinerary
of his travels, but in 1489 he was with the
army before the walls of Baza, where he probably
saw and conversed with two holy men
who had come from Jerusalem to enlist the
aid of Spain against the infidels in the Orient.</p>

<p>For eight long years he was a hanger-on
at court, ever fed on promises, put off with
half denials, and again reassured with the
prospect of assistance when the Moors should
have been subjugated. At last, in 1491, weary
and heartsick, Columbus resolved to depart
from Spain, and on his way to the coast
stopped at the convent of La Rabida, near
the port of Palos, where his distinguished
appearance attracted the attention of the
prior. This was the turning of the tide in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
his fortunes, for the prior had formerly been
confessor to the queen, and, impressed with
the scheme of his visitor, offered to intercede
in his favour. He did so, and, as the result,
Columbus was again ordered to wait upon
the queen, and with money for the journey
from the royal exchequer, set out for Santa
Fé, where he arrived in time to witness, as
we have noticed, the surrender of Granada.
But that was no propitious time for the king
or queen to engage in new adventures, with
the royal treasury drained by the terrible
drafts upon it for the Moorish wars, and
again Columbus was disappointed, and a
second time bade farewell to the court and
set out for the coast. He had, however,
proceeded but a few miles on his journey
when the queen’s courier overtook him with
the pledge of her assistance, and so he returned
to Granada. The point at which he
was halted by the courier was at the Bridge
of Pines, still spanning the stream as of yore,
and the last decisive interview is said to have
been in a corridor of the Alhambra, known
as the Hall of Justice.</p>

<p>Here, finally, amid the tumults attendant
upon the occupation of Granada, on the 17th
of April, 1492, the “capitulation” was signed,
by the terms of which the queen was to provide
the funds for the voyage, and Columbus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
was to go forth to explore the territory and
conquer the inhabitants of the unknown Western
world.</p>

<p>Some historians have asserted, and some
have denied, that the queen pledged her jewels
for the necessary funds; but certainly she is
entitled to all the glory of that adventure, since
the prudent Ferdinand looked coldly upon
the schemes of the Genoese sailor, and if his
advice had been followed he would have been
promptly dismissed. It required a lofty faith,
a serene confidence in Providence, to embark
in such an enterprise, when she may have
been already sated with the glory of conquest;
and once having pledged her assistance,
Isabella never wavered in her pecuniary
and moral support. Ten days after the “capitulation”
Columbus was at Palos with the
royal command for sailors and caravels to
be furnished by that port, and by the 1st of
August the little expedition dropped down
the Rio Tinto and made its final preparations
for the long voyage across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>All students of our history know the glorious
sequel to this voyage begun under such
discouragements: of the discovery of land
in the Bahamas in October following; of the
meetings with strange copper-coloured people
whom Columbus called “Indians”; of
the triumphant return of two out of the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
caravels that set forth, and the magnificent
reception of Columbus by his sovereigns at
their royal court in Barcelona. But with his
departure from the Spanish coast Columbus
temporarily sails out of our ken, and we must
return to trace the course of events after the
fall of Granada.</p>

<p>Happy should we be to chronicle such
events as the preceding, only; to record acts
of clemency and magnanimity toward the
conquered peoples now absolutely dependent
upon Isabella and Ferdinand for their fortunes
and their lives. But almost contemporaneously
with their arrival at the summit of
their power, the Castilian sovereigns committed
at least one act which the whole world
has regarded with aversion even to the present
day. Intent upon the union of the diverse
peoples of their extensive kingdom under
one religious faith, and perhaps with an
eye to the material advantages which might
also accrue, they issued an edict of expulsion
against the most thrifty and law-abiding inhabitants
of Spain, the Jews. These people
had long been resident here, had accumulated
vast properties, and under the Moors had
been exempt from the persecution to which
they were subject by the Goths in ancient
times and by many of their successors.</p>

<p>Learning that this terrible edict was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
contemplation, the wealthier of the Jews
offered an immense ransom to be allowed to
remain in the enjoyment of their religion
and possessions. But while this offer was
under advisement by the sovereigns, and
when they seemed to incline to mercy, it is
said that the Grand Inquisitor, Torquemada,
injected the venom of his depraved nature
into the discussion with disastrous effect.
Bursting into the royal presence, he exclaimed
with fury, as he held aloft a crucifix:
“Judas Iscariot sold his master for thirty
pieces of silver. Your Highnesses will sell
him for thirty thousand. Here he is, take
him and barter him away!” Saying this, he
dashed the crucifix upon the table and darted
from the room.</p>

<p>Sad to relate, bigotry triumphed. The
mercenary and bloodthirsty schemes of Torquemada
were carried out to the full, and
more than two hundred thousand stricken
Jews were expelled the country, losing homes,
wealth, all they possessed, which eventually
reverted to the crown through the dastardly
work of the Inquisition. This act of the
crown, by which Spain lost some of its best
subjects, was signed on the 30th of March,
1492; and thus the sovereigns, while at the
same time outstretching one hand to grasp a
new continent which was to yield them vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
treasure, yet with the other strangled domestic
thrift and trade, and undermined the
foundations of the kingdom they had sacrificed
so much to consolidate and perpetuate.</p>

<p>The Jews had brought commerce and
manufactures, they were skilled agriculturists,
some of them learned for their time; the
Moors had brought into Spain, or had developed
there, a glorious architecture, schools,
and colleges, renowned throughout Europe,
arts, and even sciences, and had reclaimed
from the desert vast areas of waste lands;
they had built beautiful cities and towns,
castles and palaces, which are the admiration
of all who see them to-day; yet both Jews
and Moors were driven from Spain as though
they were its deadly enemies. Those who
drove them forth were not capable of creating
a tithe of what the Moors and Jews had
done; to their credit is not one work of art,
not one beautiful structure of renown; but
they were through force of circumstance and
skill at arms the conquerors, and the lives
of these vastly superior peoples were at their
mercy.</p>

<p>Had they but treated them with leniency,
had they encouraged them in their peculiar
industries and pursuits, Spain would probably
have become the grandest nation in Europe,
instead of merely rising to temporary greatness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and ultimately sinking to insignificant
proportions. As with the Jews, so the Castilian
sovereigns dealt with the Moors.
Though they had stipulated on oath that
they should be protected in the observances
of their own religion, yet not long after,
urged thereto by the inquisitors of the Holy
Office, they broke their sacred pledges and
turned them over to their enemies. Many
professed to become converted, to escape
persecution, but others were driven to rebellion,
fled to the mountains and waged a
bloody war until overcome by force.</p>

<p>Says a learned historian of that time, when
the Inquisition claimed its innocent victims
by hundreds and thousands: “Now a scene
of persecution and cruelty began which far
exceeds in atrocity anything which history
has related. Every tie of nature and society
was broken, every duty and every relation
violated, and torture forced from all alike
false accusations, betrayal of friends, confession
of impossible crimes; while the actors
in these horrible tragedies were shielded by
impenetrable secrecy from the revenge of
their victims and the detestation of society.”</p>

<p>Were it not for such acts as these, and
had Isabella and Ferdinand inclined to mercy
rather than listened to the advice of bigoted
counsellors, their reign might have earned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
distinction of being, what many have claimed
for it, the greatest that Spain ever knew.
They built wisely in many things, they advanced
Spain from obscurity to become a
power among nations; they earned the love
and regard of their Christian subjects by
works promoting their welfare; but at the
same time they vitiated the good deeds by
their barbarous treatment of “heretics.”</p>

<p>It is no matter of wonder that an attempt
was made on Ferdinand’s life, in Catalonia,
soon after the capture of Granada, and
that even Isabella was not safe from covert
attack. Still, they were a well-matched pair,
and, from a worldly and contemporary point
of view, were all-sufficient to Spain in her
time of greatest need. Isabella was calm
and lucid in her counsels, inclined to benevolence
and mercy where religious questions
were not involved, and, as one writer has
expressed it, followed after Ferdinand’s armies
to garner the wheat which he had cut on
the fields of war. Ferdinand was crafty, a
diplomat whose match all Europe could not
then produce. This is shown in his conduct
of the Neapolitan wars, when he outwitted
the King of France, and eventually gathered
the rewards to himself, adding the title of
King of Naples to his other distinctions.
“Foreign affairs were conducted by the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
in behalf of Aragon, just as colonial affairs
were for the benefit of Castile.”</p>

<p>They did not lack for learned and astute
counsellors, such as Cardinal Mendoza, Torquemada,
and Ximenes. The last named,
born before his sovereigns, yet outlived
them both, and to the end was a faithful,
even though bigoted, servant and courtier.
Chosen as the queen’s confessor in 1492, he
was later appointed Archbishop of Toledo,
and after Isabella’s death became a cardinal,
throughout his career remaining loyal to the
throne.</p>

<p>Another faithful servant of the Crown
was Gonsalvo de Cordova, who fought magnificently
against the Moors, and then was
sent to carry on the wars in Naples, where
Spanish arms were so triumphant that he
earned the title of the “Great Captain,” and
covered Ferdinand’s reign with glory.</p>

<p>After the death of Isabella, which occurred
on November 26, 1504, Ferdinand’s
diplomacy continued him in power as regent
and sovereign, except for a brief term; and
it was to him that Columbus vainly appealed
for justice when, weak and broken from his
four transatlantic voyages, he came back to
endure poverty and neglect.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">WHEN SPAIN WAS GREAT.</p>

<p class="p2">Although Queen Isabella assumed all
responsibility for the first voyage of Columbus,
and is said to have declared, “I am ready
to pawn my jewels for the expenses,” yet the
treasury of Aragon has the credit of providing
the necessary funds. Already fifty-six
years of age when he started on this voyage,
Columbus had spent eighteen of the best
years of his life supplicating at courts and
pleading for recognition; so he was no longer
blessed with health and vigour. Returning
from the first triumphant achievement early
in 1493, the same year he sailed from Cadiz
with a larger fleet, and discovered islands
farther to the south than those which he
first saw and landed on, as well as the island
of Jamaica. In 1498 yet another voyage revealed
the island of Trinidad and a portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of the north coast of South America; but,
through the course of events which we can
not follow in this history, he was sent home
to Spain in chains by his enemy, Bobadilla.
The queen, though she received him with distinction,
and did all she could to soothe his
wounded sensibilities, yet was unable to secure
him another command until 1502, when
he sailed on his last and most disastrous voyage,
which ended in the wreck of his ships
on the north coast of Jamaica, and his final
return to Spain, worn with disease and broken-hearted
from abuse. Two years after the
death of Isabella he too departed this life,
in the year 1506, at the city of Valladolid,
where the house in which he died is still
pointed out to the stranger. His remains
were at first deposited in Valladolid, then
taken to Seville, and about the year 1540
transported to Santo Domingo, in accordance
with his last request.</p>

<p>Following closely in the wake of Columbus
were other voyagers and other discoverers,
notably Americus Vespucci, who, together
with a valiant Spaniard named Ojeda, sailed
along the north coast of South America from
the Pearl Islands to the Gulf of Maracaibo,
in the year 1499, trading with the natives,
and finally returning with a rich cargo of
pearls and other valuable products of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
barter. They not only obtained the beautiful
pearls which unfortunate Columbus had
somehow overlooked the year before, but
they first saw those curious people, the Lake
Dwellers, in the Gulf of Maracaibo, whose
settlements over the water suggested the
name by which the region adjacent is known
to-day, of <i>Venezuela</i>, or Little Venice. Americus
Vespucci was further rewarded, on his
return, by being appointed chart-maker to
the king, and eventually his name came to
be applied to the continent discovered by
Columbus in 1498. That, at least, was long
held to be the case, but of late years it has
been noticed that the word “America” may
have been derived from the native name of
one of the provinces on that coast, <i>Americapan</i>.</p>

<p>So we might go on tracing the extension
of Spanish conquests, until these pages,
which we have dedicated to outlining the
history of Spain, would be filled with the
doings of her valiant sons, and the numerous
adventurers attracted to her service by
the reports of her growing greatness. But
still we can not ignore these brave <i>conquistadores</i>
who sought fame and riches in the
New World, the path to which had been
opened by Columbus. Two or three years
after the death of Columbus the gallant
Ponce de Leon, then governor of a province<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of Santo Domingo, went across the channel
and conquered Puerto Rico, whence, in 1512,
he sailed to the discovery of Florida, after
his romantic search for the fabled “Fountain
of Youth.” To note how, when once
started, the stream of exploration and conquest
flowed on unimpeded, we have but to
turn to the island of Santo Domingo, discovered
by Columbus in 1492, and where
the first schemes of colonization were carried
out.</p>

<p>In the year 1509 the son of Columbus,
Don Diego, was appointed governor and
viceroy of the island, in tardy recognition
of the claim of his father to the title of
“High Admiral of the Ocean-Sea.” In 1511
one Velasquez sailed over to Cuba and there
established a colony, and with him, among
others who subsequently became famous,
was an obscure individual named Hernando
Cortes, who, fired by the reports of a new
land discovered to the west, was placed in
command of an expedition, by Velasquez,
who fitted it out; and the result was the
ultimate conquest of the vast territory of
Mexico, which was first brought to notice
by Hernandez de Cordova in 1517. From
this conquest, which was not achieved until
about 1521-’22, flowed millions and millions
in treasure to fill the coffers of Spain. Cortes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
himself, a man of humble origin, was
born in Spain in 1485, only seven years before
Columbus sailed on his first voyage;
yet he added a kingdom to the realms of
Spain before he was forty years of age!</p>

<p>In the year 1513 the brave but unfortunate
Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, from a high
point in the Isthmus of Darien, saw, first of
all Europeans, the vast Pacific; yet it was
not until nearly twenty years afterward that
Francisco Pizarro, the ignorant soldier, who
was born in the same province as Cortes, in
Spain, and who had served with Gonsalvo de
Cordova in Italy, subjugated the native people
of Peru, and made himself a virtual king.
By the conquest of Peru and the murder of
the Inca by Pizarro more than fifteen million
dollars in treasure was secured, and ultimately
the mines of that country enriched Spain
for many, many years.</p>

<p>So, as we have seen, Spain was prolific
in men of force and gallantry, who poured
out their blood freely for her sake, and who
ventured their lives rashly in the expeditions
she sent forth. The long wars with the
Moors, lasting for centuries, had brought
forth a race of soldiers unequalled perhaps
in any other country at that time. They
seem to have been bred and nurtured for
these very deeds of risk and heroism which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
were born of their encounters with the natives
of the New World; for self-denial, for
intrepidity under almost insuperable difficulties.
They were also fierce and cruel&mdash;how
fierce and how cruel it is only necessary to
read of the conquest of Mexico by Cortes;
of the conquest of Peru by Pizarro; yes, of
the treatment of the innocent natives by
Columbus himself, who initiated the system
of slavery, by which eventually they were
extinguished in the West Indies. Humanity
was foreign to their nature; long familiarity
with the bloody work of the Inquisition in
the home country, the persecution of Moors
and Jews, the scenes of rapine and massacre
they had witnessed and heard reported by
their fathers, had accustomed these <i>conquistadores</i>
to cruelty and merciless oppression.
Even the gentlest and most merciful of them
were so only by comparison, for their progress
everywhere could be traced by ruin and
desolation, by ravaged homes and murdered
men, women, and children.</p>

<p class="p2">Contemporaneously with her conquests in
the New World, Spain herself acquired increasing
territory in Europe, not alone by
force of arms, but chiefly through matrimonial
alliances and succession to power. To
understand how this came about, we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
retrace our course and bestow a parting
glance upon the affairs of Isabella and Ferdinand.
This royal pair, under whom Spain
had at last become consolidated into a veritable
kingdom, with a union of interests if
not unity of purpose always, had five children
born to them: Juan, the only son, born 1478,
who married a daughter of Maximilian, Emperor
of Germany, but died without heirs, in
1497; Isabella, born 1470, married twice, to
two princes of Portugal, whose only child
lived but two years; Juana, born 1479, married
to the Archduke Philip, son of Maximilian,
who had two sons, Charles and Ferdinand;
Mary, born 1482, and Catherine, born
1485, who became the unfortunate wife of
Henry VIII of England, and from whom she
was divorced in 1533.</p>

<p>By the death of Juan in 1497, of Isabella
in 1498, and of the latter’s child two years
later, the succession to the throne now devolved
upon Juana, in accordance with the
will of her mother, Isabella, executed in October,
1504. King Ferdinand, who had so
successfully administered the affairs of the
crown of Castile during thirty years, was
appointed regent until Juana’s elder son,
Charles, should attain to his majority.</p>

<p>Though at first there was a disagreement
between Ferdinand and Philip, Juana’s husband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
as to the regency, all difficulties were
settled in 1505 by mutual agreement, and
the next year, by the sudden death of the
young archduke, the king became sole regent,
and virtually ruler over all Spain. Juana,
the bereaved “lady proprietor,” was crazed
by this affliction, smiting upon a mind already
diseased, and until her death, forty-seven
years after, took no part in the affairs of
the kingdom. As <i>Juana loca</i>, or “Crazy
Jane,” she is known to history. She became
most insanely jealous respecting her dead
husband’s remains, would not allow them
interred, and journeyed with them from
place to place, always in the night; for,
she mournfully said, “A widow who has
lost the sun of her own soul should never
expose herself to the light of day.” Thus
she lived in mental darkness, in her palace of
Tordesillas, for nearly half a century, an object
of pity and commiseration.</p>

<p>Left at liberty to pursue his conquests
where he would, Ferdinand first turned to
matrimony, and married Germaine, a frivolous
niece of Louis XII of France, in 1506.
Three years later his great cardinal, Ximenes,
waged war on Oran, a port on the African
coast, equipped an army at his own expense&mdash;or
rather from the revenues he derived
from his position as Primate of Spain&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
took the Moorish stronghold after great
slaughter on both sides. The figure of this
austere and virtuous cardinal, who so faithfully
served first Isabella, then Ferdinand,
Juana, and finally Charles, and who found
time to attend to affairs of state and to
purge the kingdom of its heretics through
inquisitorial fires, to carry on a war at his
own cost, to found a university, to cause to be
translated the famous Complutensian Bible,
which employed men of learning fifteen
years at the task&mdash;his is one of the sturdiest
and strongest of this epoch. The University
of Alcala, founded in 1500, and the renowned
Bible, the last portion of which was printed
in 1517, are but two of the many monuments
he erected during his life.</p>

<p>In the year 1511 the Holy League was
formed between Ferdinand and Pope Julius II,
Venice, and Henry VIII of England, against
the French, by which Spain was the gainer;
and in 1512 Navarre was annexed to Aragon,
thus welding the northern kingdoms into one.
In December, 1515, Gonsalvo de Cordova,
the “Great Captain,” who had won Ferdinand’s
victories in Italy, passed away; to be
followed but a month later by his sovereign,
who expired on a morning in January, 1516,
in a wretched tenement where he had been

<p>He was in his sixty-fourth year; his reign
had endured forty-one years, and at his death
he left a reputation for ability, wisdom in
diplomacy, sincere interest in the affairs of
his people, and economy in the administration
of the vast dominions embraced under
his kingship over Spain, Naples, and the two
Americas.</p>

<p>For more than twenty years he had borne
the title bestowed upon him by Pope Alexander,
in 1494, and as the great King of
Spain, Ferdinand “the Catholic,” he has
passed down to history and the present time.
His remains were taken to Granada, where
they were at first deposited within the Alhambra;
but to-day all that is earthly of
Ferdinand and his glorious consort repose in
the magnificent marble tomb in the royal
chapel of Granada, which with its exquisite
carvings and memorial effigies, was executed
by world-famous artists at the command of
Charles, the son of <i>Juana loca</i> the demented
queen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">CHARLES I AND PHILIP II.</p>

<p class="p2">Charles, elder son of Juana, and grandson
of Isabella and Ferdinand, was born in
the year 1500, at Ghent, and all his life held
an affection for the people of his native land,
which the Spaniards never shared. Still, he
was virtually King of Spain at the death of
his grandfather Ferdinand, and his mother,
owing to her lunacy, only nominally queen.
Henceforth, for more than half a century,
this grandson of the King of Aragon and
Queen of Castile appears the dominant figure,
the greatest ruler, in Europe. “It has
been said that Charles had more power for
good or ill in Europe than has been exercised
by any man since the reign of Augustus;
and that, on the whole, he did as much
harm with it as could possibly be done.”</p>

<p>This is the verdict of an impartial historian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and seems borne out by the facts,
for his long reign was chiefly one of war,
and waged more for personal aggrandizement
than for reasons of state. He was
seventeen years of age when he first entered
Spain, the year following Ferdinand’s
death, and eighteen when proclaimed king
at Valladolid. The interregnum had been
skilfully bridged by Cardinal Ximenes, who
had vigorously suppressed various insurrections
caused by the dissatisfaction of the
nobles and the people at the introduction of
a host of foreigners, greedy and rapacious,
from the Flemish country. Notwithstanding
the great services of the octogenarian Ximenes,
who had so faithfully served not alone
the young prince, but before him his mother
and grandparents, he sent him a frivolous letter
containing implied reproof, which reached
the cardinal either just before or just after
his demise, which occurred in November,
1517. Adrian of Utrecht, subsequently Pope,
succeeded Ximenes, under whom Charles’s
forces met and overcame the rebels, headed
by Juan de Padilla, in 1522.</p>

<p>In January, 1519, another great personage
departed this life, in the death of Maximilian,
Emperor of Germany, paternal grandfather
of the young King of Spain, upon
whom, in June of the same year, was bestowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the imperial crown. He was thus at
nineteen years of age, as Charles V of Germany
and Charles I of Spain, sovereign over
a vastly wider realm than any Castilian king
had ever dreamed of conquering. From his
father, Philip, he had inherited dominion
over the Netherlands and Franche-Comté;
through his mother and from Ferdinand the
kingdoms of Spain; and now, by the Diet of
Frankfort, he was made Emperor of Germany.
It may be said that with his coronation at
Aix-la-Chapelle, in October, 1520, his troubles
really began; for Francis, the French king,
also young and powerful, urged a right to
the crown; and henceforth, until the death
of the latter, in 1547, there was enmity between
them.</p>

<p>That same year occurred the famous
meeting on the Field of the Cloth of Gold,
between French Francis and Henry VIII
of England; but not long after Henry was
fighting as an ally of Charles against the
King of France. To recount their quarrels
and battles would be too wearisome as well
as fruitless a task; but they culminated at
the famous battle of Pavia, when the French
king’s army was routed, and Francis himself
taken prisoner by the Spaniards, in 1524.
He was not released until he had forfeited
his claims to Charles’s possessions in Burgundy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
etc., and returned to France in January,
1526, after signing the Treaty of Madrid,
and leaving as hostages two of his sons.</p>

<p>But Francis did not respect his promises,
and soon there was war again between the
two, more battles, more signing of treaties,
more shedding of blood and devastation of
territories, until the war-worn subjects of
both sovereigns were weary of a conflict in
which they obtained no gains and shared no
profits. Especially were the Spaniards wroth
at being repeatedly called upon to donate
funds and men, men and funds, for the carrying
on of foreign wars. Yet they rarely rebelled,
and only grumbled and protested
when the Cortes was called, knowing that it
meant only more money for the king and his
favourites, more sacrifices at the feet of Moloch
the insatiate. Through all the years of
his reign Charles was carrying on war of
another kind, also, with the enemies of the
Romish Church. Simultaneously with his
coronation as Emperor of Germany rose the
apparition of Protestantism in the person of
the redoubtable Luther; and the assembling
of the Diet of Worms, for the discussion and
extermination of Lutheranism, was one of the
first acts of the young sovereign, in January,
1521. It was an unequal fight, that between
the poor peasant-priest Luther and the mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
emperor; yet, though the former died in
1541, his cause eventually won&mdash;as all the
world knows&mdash;and not all Charles’s efforts
could strangle in its cradle the young giant
of Reformation.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-six Charles married
Isabella of Portugal, a beautiful princess, to
whom he was much attached, and who became
the mother of his only legitimate son, Philip
II, who was born in 1527. That same year
Charles was called upon to wage another
little war with Francis, who had broken his
pledges and formed a league with Henry of
England and the Pope. The Spanish armies,
under lead of the recreant Constable
of Bourbon, overran Italian territories, took
and sacked the city of Rome, committing
every imaginable excess, and ending by making
the Pope himself a prisoner. Although
his own army had committed this sacrilege,
Charles pretended to be grieved at the event,
particularly at the indignity offered to the
person of the Pope; but only three years
later he had the imperial crown set upon his
brow by this same Pope Clement, who had
only regained his liberty by the payment of
a heavy ransom.</p>

<p>The treaty then signed by the hitherto
hostile belligerents, called the Peace of Cambrai,
was probably hastened by the threatened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
invasion of western Europe by the Mohammedans
under Soleyman the Magnificent;
and it was this fear also that caused Charles
to treat his Protestant subjects so leniently
in Germany, when in Spain they would all
have been burned at the stake or put to the
sword. But he needed their valiant arms in
opposing the Moslems of Turkey in their
victorious progress; hence they were temporarily
spared, to grow eventually into a
body politic of such proportions that, to his
sorrow, they eventually overcame him. He,
however, vindicated his claim to be considered
the champion of Christendom, in
1535, by organizing an expedition against
Barbarossa, the pirate king, and liberating
hundreds of Christians confined in the dungeons
of Tunis. Another attempt upon Algiers,
in 1541, resulted in the dispersion of
the Spanish fleet by a storm, and disastrous
defeat. The year 1536 was made memorable
to the citizens of Ghent because, having refused
to furnish their quota for carrying on
the wars in France, they were treated by
Charles as rebels and punished with terrible
severity.</p>

<p>In 1540 Loyola established in Spain the
order of Jesuits, which subsequently came to
have such influence in religious and political
affairs. The French king in 1542 renewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
hostilities, and after two years of warfare a
peace was declared, in 1544. About this
time it seemed to Charles that the occasion
was ripe for a war of extermination against
his Protestant subjects of Germany. At first
he triumphed over their large and well-equipped
armies, in 1547 defeating the Elector
of Saxony and taking him prisoner.
That year, also, Francis of France died, and
thus the emperor was left freer to persecute
those who differed from him in their religious
beliefs. But a Protestant champion soon
arose in the person of Prince Maurice of Saxony,
whose vigorous action not only reduced
the emperor to the humiliating necessity of
signing a treaty of peace (August 2, 1552),
but set in motion a train of events that forever
made impossible his cherished project
of the rooting out of Protestantism.</p>

<p>Three disastrous years of warfare followed
the Peace of Passau, but nothing was gained
for Charles, and in 1555, by the Peace of
Augsburg, his hated enemy, Protestantism,
scored a triumph through receiving legal recognition,
by which its roots struck so deep
into European soil that no efforts of the emperor’s
could avail to extricate them. It is
thought that the humiliation of this defeat of
his lifelong scheme in behalf of the papists
was the cause of his final determination to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
abdicate in favour of his son Philip, which he
did in October of the same year, 1555. His
mother, Juana, died this year, having passed
the whole term of her son’s brilliant reign in
the gloom of insanity.</p>

<p>In January, 1556, he formally ceded all
his Spanish possessions to Philip, and retired
to the monastery of Yuste, where he passed
three years more in the quietude of peaceful
scenes, and finally expired on the 21st of
September, 1558.</p>

<p>After forty years of fighting, he found
nothing so delightful as the seclusion of a
monastery; after mingling in the stirring
scenes of a world of which he was at times
the most prominent figure and centre around
which it moved, he found nothing so conducive
to tranquillity and happiness as the
domestic avocations of gardening and carving
simple toys. He had crossed central
and western Europe forty times, had visited
England, carried war into Africa, had battled
with the French, the British, the Italians,
and Turks; while at the same time his great
captains had subjugated the natives of the
two Americas, and deluged the western isles
and continents with blood. Mexico, Peru,
and Chili were reduced to submission during
his reign. In 1521 the great navigator, Magellan,
had passed through the straits that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
now bear his name and circumnavigated
South America, on that same voyage discovering
the Philippine Islands, which were
afterward named in honour of Philip II.</p>

<p>We should pause here to note that it was
during Charles’s reign that Spain’s history
became inextricably mingled with or touched
upon that of every great division of the
world, and that the emperor held possessions
in Asia, Africa, Europe, North and South
America.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">SPAIN’S RELIGIOUS WARS.</p>

<p class="p2">The keynote of Philip’s character was
bigotry. Trained in diplomacy by his imperial
father, brought up in the atmosphere
of royal courts, born to intrigue and bred to
dissimulation, he early gave promise of a
great future which he never fulfilled.</p>

<p>When, at his abdication, in 1555, Charles
admonished his son to “fear God, live justly,
respect the laws; above all, cherish the interests
of religion,” he really meant, as the
codicil to his will expressed, in 1558: “Keep
alive the fires of the Inquisition, and exterminate
every heretic in the kingdom.” And,
so far as it lay in his power, the filial son
obeyed the precepts of his father to the
letter!</p>

<p>Born in 1527, at twelve years of age he
lost his mother by death, and at twenty-seven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
or in 1554, he was married to “Bloody Mary,”
Queen of England, and thus became titular
King of the British Isles, though never actually
and actively engaged in the affairs of
that kingdom during the fourteen months
of his residence there. Indirectly, the result
of this alliance was a fearful persecution of
Mary’s Protestant subjects, and the burning
at the stake of martyrs like Latimer and
Cranmer, and more than three hundred others,
before she died in 1558. Fortunately
for England, no children were born of this
alliance, the evil results of which were shown
by the war with France, into which Mary
was drawn by Philip, and the loss of Calais
to the English. “When I am dead, Calais
will be found written on my heart,” said
the unhappy queen; but the faithless husband,
for whom she sacrificed so much, was
not inconsolable at her death, and soon
again embarked in matrimony.</p>

<p>In truth, Philip was already a widower
when he espoused Mary Tudor, for he had
been married to Maria, daughter of King
John of Portugal, in 1543, who died within
two years, leaving a son, Don Carlos, who
became an object of suspicion to his unnatural
father, by whom he was imprisoned, and
probably poisoned, in 1568.</p>

<p>Shortly after the death of Mary of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Philip sued for the hand of her sister,
Elizabeth, who scornfully repelled him, and
in June, 1559, he married Isabella, daughter
of Henry II of France. His marital record
was completed when, in 1570, after the death
of Isabella, he espoused his niece, Anne of
Austria, daughter of Emperor Maximilian
II. Thus within the space of twenty-seven
years he had been four times married, three
times to the daughters of kings and once
to the daughter of an emperor. But his
various attempts to ally himself with royalty&mdash;with
the reigning houses of Portugal, England,
France, and Austria&mdash;resulted in no
direct benefit to him or to his kingdom. A
curious if not revolting circumstance attending
two of these marriages was, that
while Mary of England was at one time the
betrothed bride of his father, Isabella of
France was intended for his son Don Carlos!
It is supposed that it was on account of his
jealousy of the relations between his lovely
bride and his son that Philip persecuted and
imprisoned the latter, and finally hounded
him to his death.</p>

<p>In war and diplomacy Philip was at first
more fortunate than in matrimony, for in
1557 his generals gained the important victory
of San Quentin, and of Gravelines, 1558,
over the French, between whom and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Spanish and English a treaty of peace was
signed in 1559. It was at this time that the
English lost Calais, and the French much
territory; the only benefits accruing to Philip
of Spain, who acquired two hundred towns
in Italy and the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Although opponents in war, Henry II of
France and Philip II of Spain were of one
religion, and united as against their heretical
subjects; so the alliance with Isabella
was quite in the natural course of events.
In a tournament which followed the ceremony
the King of France was accidentally
killed by the Scotch captain of his guards,
the Count of Montgomery; and thus Queen
Isabella began in sorrow that sad, short period
of married life with Philip II which was
terminated by her early death.</p>

<p>After a visit to the Spanish Netherlands,
in 1559, Philip returned to Spain, and never
again set foot on Flemish soil. But he
always kept those distant provinces within
his ken; not with their best interests at
heart, but with a view to crushing out the
Protestants with fire and with sword. He left
his half-sister, Margaret, Duchess of Parma,
to rule in his absence, assisted by Cardinal
Grenville, and with instructions to root out
heresy from the land, at whatever cost.
Spain at that time had its prisons filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
victims of the Holy Office; its <i>autos-da-fé</i>,
or burnings of heretics at the stake,
were of weekly occurrence, no Sabbath being
deemed complete without these dismal spectacles.</p>

<p>But in the Low Countries the infamous
inquisitors encountered a resistance more
formidable than from the passive wretches
of downtrodden Spain. Though their streets
flowed with human blood, though the flames
rose from every square and market place, yet
the Netherlanders opposed the attempt to
subvert them. They rose in rebellion when
the Inquisition was introduced, in 1565, and
to suppress them the great Duke of Alva,
who had won victories for both Charles and
Philip, was despatched with an army considered
sufficient for the purpose. This general,
of consummate abilities yet of monstrous cruelty,
afterward boasted that he had executed
eighteen thousand men by hanging and
drowning, by the rack and fire, besides the
many killed in battle. He put to death
Counts Egmont and Horn, drove the valiant
William of Orange into exile; and the flames
of war and bitterness which he kindled lasted
for more than two generations, resulting in
the eventual loss of all the northern Netherlands
to Spain. He was rewarded by the
Pope with the title of supreme Defender of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the Faith, but left the country pursued by
the maledictions of the people. His infamous
“Council of Blood” rode rough-shod over all
the rights of the people, and sent to the
gallows and the block the highest and the
wealthiest of the country, whose properties
were confiscated for the benefit of the
king. At last, after the northern provinces
had maintained a successful war for several
years, the Duke of Alva was recalled, and
the king’s half-brother, Don John of Austria,
was sent in his stead. One of Alva’s last
offices was to conquer Portugal for Philip, in
1580.</p>

<p>During this gloomy period in the Netherlands
there occurred several things of importance
in Spain and the farther East which
had a bearing on the fortunes of the Christian
world. At home a Moorish rebellion
disturbed the land. Goaded to desperation
by oppressive laws, hunted like beasts by the
familiars of the Holy Office, at last the Moriscoes
could endure no more. Many fled to
the mountains and organized a rebellion,
which for several years kept the Spanish soldiers
actively engaged ferreting them out in
their retreats and dragging them to death.
“Better not reign at all, rather than over a
nation of heretics,” was Philip’s declaration
as the Moors begged for the retention of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
ancient religion and forms of dress. He was
determined to make them all conform to his
own ideal of religious faith; and the result
was loss and irreparable disaster to the country
over which he reigned as king. By the
year 1572 the rebellion was crushed, its leaders
all murdered, and the unfortunate Moriscoes
scattered in exile far from the homes of
their ancestors, where hitherto they had been
peacefully tilling the soil and engaged in
manufactures that redounded to the benefit
of Spain.</p>

<p>In the year 1571, in alliance with Rome
and Venice, Spain arrested the westward-flowing
flood of Mohammedanism at Lepanto,
one of the “decisive battles of the world,”
when one hundred and thirty Turkish galleys
were wrecked or captured, twenty-five thousand
Turks were killed, twelve thousand
Christian galley slaves liberated from their
living death, and vast booty taken from the
enemy.</p>

<p>Lepanto was the western limit of Islam’s
latest advance in Europe; after that fateful
battle it receded toward the Orient. But for
King Philip’s insane jealousy of his half-brother,
Don John of Austria, who so bravely
led the Christian hosts, the allied forces
might have laid siege to Constantinople; as
it was, Don John sailed across the Mediterranean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
with twenty thousand men and captured
Tunis, on the African coast. It was
soon after retaken by the Turks, and many
years later the other Spanish dependencies
went the same way.</p>

<p>On the other side of the Pyrenees, in
France, an event occurred in 1572 peculiarly
acceptable to Philip&mdash;the atrocious massacre
of Saint Bartholomew’s night, when four thousand
Huguenots were murdered in cold blood,
through the treachery of the queen regent,
Catherine de’ Medici, and her son Charles IX.
In the provinces of France at least thirty thousand
more fell victims of the hate and fury
of their compatriots who differed from them
in their religious belief; and they could not
fly to Spain for succour, for there sat their inveterate
enemy, who was only too anxious to
interfere in the affairs of France. He had
his hands full, with the encroaching Moslems
on one side and the obstinate Netherlanders
on the other; yet he found time to attend to
all these things, and to manage the affairs of
his vast empire in the New World also.</p>

<p>Two years after the recall of Alva from
the Low Countries, or in 1575, Holland and
Zealand were united under Philip’s bitterest
enemy, William of Orange, and the next year
witnessed the famous “Pacification of Ghent”
between the Protestant and Catholic provinces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
by which the Inquisition was declared
abolished, mutual toleration agreed to in religious
matters, and a united stand maintained
against the Spanish soldiery. In 1578 the free
states brought about a treaty with Queen
Elizabeth of England, and the next year the
Union of Utrecht&mdash;a stepping-stone to their
great and final declaration of independence
and repudiation of Spain, in 1581. As the
Duke of Parma, who had succeeded Don John
of Austria, advised the removal of the head
and front of the opposition in the person of
the noble patriot William the Silent, Philip at
once declared him a miscreant and outlaw,
and offered a reward of twenty-five thousand
crowns to whoever would murder him. This
is the reason why Philip II of Spain has been
called the murderer of William the Silent,
because, instigated by the proffered reward,
a miserable wretch was finally successful in
assassinating William, in July, 1584. Although
he himself did not point the pistol
which ended the life of William the Silent,
yet Philip was as actually his murderer as if
he had done so; likewise of his secretary,
Escovedo, of his own son, Don Carlos, of the
Counts Egmont and Horn, of Don John of
Austria, and thousands of others who were put
to the sword, beheaded, hanged, and burned
to death by his commands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Were we writing the history of the Netherlands
we might find examples of Philip’s
tortures, might produce evidence of his most
inhuman cruelty to his brother man too revolting,
too horrible for contemplation. He
reminds us of nothing so much as of a vile
and venomous spider intrenched in his web at
Madrid, whence radiate threads of communication
to the confines of his realm&mdash;to Naples
and the Netherlands, to Africa and the Americas&mdash;all
connecting with the capital where
sits this arch-enemy of mankind, absorbing
the life-blood of his innumerable victims.
This human spider rioted in scenes of blood,
yet rarely shed blood directly by his own
hand; his foul parasites executed his commands,
and burned and strangled by his orders;
he was Briareus-like; no one could escape
him; no life was safe if once he wanted
it. So it was that, while he gratified his hideous
instincts, his country became poorer and
poorer; while he sucked the blood of his prey,
he also sapped the land of its vitality; his
armies were numerous, his wars were costly,
and as he had encouraged no domestic industries&mdash;had
killed rather than fostered skilled
artisans&mdash;all the vast wealth brought to the
shores of Spain by her flotillas of treasure
galleons was absorbed by unworthy favourites,
was scattered abroad on many a battlefield,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
or went to reward hired assassins and a
mercenary soldiery. For the credit of humanity,
for the credit of the cause of religion&mdash;which
he pretended to champion and up-hold&mdash;we
would his life were otherwise than
what it was; but it has been said of him, and
of his father, Charles I, that no other sovereigns
with such glorious privileges, with such
great opportunities for doing so much good,
ever did so much harm!</p>

<p>The Netherlands may be considered as
lost to Spain when their cause was championed
by the “Virgin Queen” Elizabeth,
who sent, in 1586, the Earl of Leicester to
represent her with an army. It was at a
skirmish attending one of the battles of this
year that there fell one who has received almost
immortal acclaim for his knightly courtesy:
Sir Philip Sidney, who, dying, refused a
cup of water that a brother soldier might be
refreshed.</p>

<p>Though King Philip may have welcomed
a war with England, as a hotbed of Protestantism
and the realm over which ruled Elizabeth,
whose refusal to marry him still rankled
in his bosom, yet he was soon to regret it.
For, in 1587, that great sea-lion, Sir Francis
Drake&mdash;not then “Sir,” however, but plain
Admiral&mdash;pounced upon the seaport of Cadiz,
sank two hundred and fifty galleys and transports,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and created consternation everywhere
in Spain.</p>

<p>The next year, in spite of Drake’s ravages,
sailed the great armada&mdash;one hundred and
forty ships and thirty thousand men, with
friars, inquisitors, etc.&mdash;for the conquest and
conversion of England: argosies in which
were centred the hopes of Spain; only to be
crushed and defeated by one half its number
of English ships, combined with the adverse
elements, so that only a pitiful remnant returned
to Spanish ports. A last expiring
effort at naval supremacy was made in 1595;
but this fleet also was sunk, carrying with it
Spain’s prestige on the ocean wave.</p>

<p>And at last, in misery and torture from a
loathsome disease, at the age of seventy-one,
in the year 1598, Philip II departed this life;
his chief legacy an impoverished kingdom,
his greatest monument the Escorial, that
palace, monastery, mausoleum, library, upon
which he had spent thirty years of time and
lavished millions of treasure.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.</p>

<p class="p2">Two royal lives practically extend throughout
the sixteenth century, or from the year
1500 to 1598. The lives and reigns of three
of their successors carry us forward exactly
a century further, for Philip III reigned
from 1598-1621; Philip IV, 1621-1665; and
Charles II, 1665-1700. The house of Hapsburg
had come in with Charles I, who was
also Charles V of Germany; it terminated in
Spain in the reign of Charles II, after an even
two hundred years of power.</p>

<p>It will do us no harm to recapitulate, that
under Isabella and Ferdinand the Spanish
monarchy was consolidated; under Charles
I it grew to be an empire, wide-extended,
world-embracing; and under Phillip II began
to shrink again to meaner proportions.</p>

<p>Charles could not secure the empire to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
son, as it went to his brother Ferdinand,
neither could he bestow upon him transcendent
abilities; but Philip equalled him in
his intensity of purpose, his capacity for protracted
labour, his inclination to provoke war,
and surpassed him in religious fanaticism.
Both, however, were self-sufficient, needing
no counsellors, no outside help to formulate
their plans of action. With the incoming of
Philip III we witness the beginning of a long
line of favourites, of irresponsible courtiers,
under whom Spain suffered for nearly two
centuries more. The first was Sandoval,
whom his royal servant created Duke of
Lerma, and under whom (notwithstanding the
death of Holland’s great ally, Elizabeth, in
1603) the United Provinces gained their
virtual independence by the Treaty of Antwerp,
in 1610. The Netherlands were under
the comparatively mild sway of the Infanta
Isabella, her armies led by the Archduke Albert
and the Marquis Spinola, and opposed
by Prince Maurice of Nassau. By the end
of the first decade of this century the Dutch
East India Company was established, and
their fleets not only brought rich cargoes to
Holland, but they preyed upon Spanish commerce
as well. To such a condition, finally,
had Philip II’s policy brought affairs, that
after thirty years his former vassals, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
sturdy rebels of the northern Netherlands,
were rejoicing over inflowing wealth, while
Spain’s treasuries were empty, or exhausted
as soon as replenished.</p>

<p>Though without that positive power for
evil possessed by his father, Philip III was
malignant, capable at times of great evil, as
was shown in his expulsion of the Moriscoes,
or the last of the Moors, in 1609. At this time
the bulk of them were living in Valencia, where
they were highly esteemed for their sobriety,
diligence, conformity to the laws, and as
skilled artisans; but owing to the suggestion
of the Archbishop of Toledo, Sandoval’s
brother, Philip banished them all to Africa,
to the number of more than half a million,
where and in the voyage thither they suffered
incredible hardships. Their only blame lay
in their industry and thrift, and the country
soon felt their loss through a further decline
of its agriculture, manufactures, and mining.
Thus departed from Spain the last vestige of
the Moors, whose ancestors had invaded the
peninsula nine hundred years before. With
them, and with the Jews, departed also in
great measure the country’s prosperity. The
Moors, says a writer on Spain, had brought
here the cultivation of the mulberry, sugar
cane, cotton, and rice. The spices and sweets
of Valencia were famous, as well as the sword<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
blades of Toledo, the silks of Granada, and
the leather of Cordova. Nobody knows the
extent of Moorish treasure still buried in
Spain; but if the Spaniards had spent as
much time in tilling the soil as in hunting
for the undiscovered gold and jewels, the
country would be more prosperous than it is
to-day.</p>

<p>Weak, vacillating, swayed by his wife and
his favourites, Philip III was yet morose
and melancholy, and eventually turned upon
Lerma, forcing him to retire to his country
seat, but not until after the Church had made
him a cardinal.</p>

<p>The eldest son of Philip III succeeded him
at his death, in 1521, which is said to have
been hastened by the punctilious etiquette of
his court, caused by delay in removing him
from a fire, near which he had been seated by
one of the attendants.</p>

<p>As Philip IV, the new heir to the throne
dabbled in disastrous wars to even a greater
extent than his father, and he could not prevent
being drawn into the vortex of that terrible
Thirty Years’ War (1618-’48) between
the Catholics and Protestants of Europe. It
was a legacy, indeed, from his great-grandfather,
Charles, who had been compelled to a
truce with the Lutherans, when he would fain
have exterminated them, eighty years before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>This, the fourth Philip of the Spanish
line, although called “Philip the Great,” must
needs have a royal favourite in one Gasparo
de Guzman, Duke of Olivarez, for whose misfortunes
he served as a scapegoat. Olivarez
began well, by executing a former sub-favourite,
Calderon, and prosecuting Lerma
for his fraudulent practices&mdash;a proceeding
which has an aspect of grim humour, in view
of his own subsequent venality and official
corruption. He sent Spinola to war again
with the Netherlands, that grave of so many
Spanish soldiers; but the Dutch were now
too strong for the mother of tyrants, and
not many years after, in 1628, captured the
Spanish treasure fleet, and in 1639 almost
annihilated the Spanish navy at Dunkirk.
He was scarcely more fortunate in Italy; he
even ventured to match himself against that
past-master of diplomacy and intrigue, Cardinal
Richelieu, with a result that might have
been expected. His tyranny and oppressive
exactions raised a revolt in Catalonia, which
lasted thirteen years; and it was about this
time that Portugal threw off the coils which
Philip II had wound around her and regained
an independence which she has ever since retained.</p>

<p>The reign of Olivarez came to an end after
twenty years or so of maladministration, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Spain’s territorial losses went on under his
nephew and successor, Luis de Haro. All
through the history of these times there
was always an undercurrent of war between
France and Spain, now one nation and then
the other being victorious. Hitherto the
prestige of the Spanish soldiery had been
sufficient to hold the French in check; but
Turenne took from them Roussillon, in 1642,
and at the battle of Rocroi, the next year, the
great Condé administered a crushing defeat,
so that their century-long reputation for invincibility
was shattered. Condé again defeated
the famous Spanish infantry at the battle of
Lens, in 1648, and that same year a final peace
was concluded with the Netherlands. On the
sea Spanish ships were again defeated by the
renowned Van Tromp, the same Dutch admiral
who sailed with a broom at his mast head
in token that he had swept the seas clean of
his country’s enemies. Until this period the
transatlantic possessions of Spain had been
kept intact, though many coast cities and
towns had been bombarded, and fleets of
treasure galleons destroyed; but in 1665 one
of Cromwell’s admirals took the island of
Jamaica, and this was the beginning of such
losses by Spain.</p>

<p>All these defeats, with but few redeeming
victories, reduced Spain from the once proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
position she had held as dictator in European
affairs to become subordinate to France, her
ancient enemy. By the Peace of Westphalia,
in 1648, Spain had suffered indirect defeat, as
thereby the Protestants had secured religious
toleration, against which Charles I and the
three Philips had fought for more than a century.
By this peace, also, France and Spain
were left the only combatants on the field of
European warfare, but in 1659 they came to
terms by the Treaty of the Pyrenees; France
gave back to Spain her territory of Catalonia,
and Spain ceded to France Artois and Roussillon.
Further, a promising guaranty of the
stability of this present peace was the marriage
the following year of the Infanta Maria
Teresa, Philip’s eldest daughter by his first
wife, to the great king, Louis XIV of France.
Six years later, after a protracted struggle,
the decisive battle of Villaviciosa lost Portugal
finally to Spain, at the news of which the
king was so affected that he swooned away,
his death occurring shortly afterward, September
17, 1665.</p>

<p>One would think that peace might now
reign between France and Spain, since Philip
IV left his throne to a helpless child of four
years, whose brother-in-law was King Louis
XIV. But Louis the despot was a law unto
himself. He no sooner saw the opportunity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
with Spain powerless to oppose him, and
his hands free in other directions, than he
promptly sent his armies into the Netherlands.
Alarmed at his schemes of conquest,
England, Sweden, and Holland joined together
in the “Triple Alliance,” which for a
while held him in check, until they tied his
hands again in 1668 by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.
At the Spanish court, meanwhile,
affairs were in a scandalous condition, for the
queen regent was ruled at first by a German
Jesuit, and later foisted into favour an agreeable
young man who had been merely a page,
and whose highest conception of pleasure was
to occupy the place of honour at a bullfight.
If it may be said of the reign of Philip IV
that it was the most disastrous to Spain since
that of King Roderick the Goth, little more
can be claimed for that of Charles II, his son,
who came into the succession in 1675, at the
age of fourteen. Like all the issue of Philip
II, he was weak almost to idiocy, and so superstitious
that in later life he had himself
exorcised for witchcraft.</p>

<p>His uncle, Don John, at first assisted him
with his counsels, but after his death a favourite
named Eguya succeeded him, to be
followed by the Duke of Medina Celi, then
by the Count of Oropesa; and none of them
laboured for the aggrandizement of Spain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
By the Treaty of Nimeguen, in 1678, and by
the Twenty Years’ Truce of Ratisbon, Louis
XIV should have abstained from further aggressions,
but his mischief-loving spirit was
not to be curbed. He invaded Catalonia in
1689, bombarded Alicante and Barcelona,
capturing the latter, and acted in a manner
altogether in keeping with the character of
this treacherous and unfaithful monarch,
whose long life is but a record of infamy.</p>

<p>By the Peace of Ryswick, in 1697, Louis
unexpectedly gave back to Spain all the territory
he had conquered, an act inexplicable
until the terms of the secret “Partition
Treaty” became known, when it was found
that he had arranged for the partition of
Spain, with the assistance of other powers,
by which his son the dauphin was to have
the bulk of the dominions, including the
Italian possessions.</p>

<p>Spain had now become so weak that the
expected death of her king was the signal for
a gathering of her royal neighbours, who sat
around like vultures expectant of their prey
until the pitiful apology of a monarch at last
shuffled off this mortal coil. The last of his
house to reign in Spain, intellectually degenerate
and physically impotent, Charles II
passed away, leaving no direct heir to the
throne. Before his death, however, aware of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the coalition against the throne in the event
of no successor being named, Charles willed
his dominions to the electoral Prince of
Bavaria, whose mother was a daughter of
Philip IV. But the prince died before the
king, and this reopened the question of succession,
which will be treated in the next
chapter.</p>

<p class="p2">It is one of the paradoxes of civilization
that a barren or a blood-fertilized soil sometimes
produces the most luxuriant growth
and yields the richest harvests. So with
Spain. During the century of her greatest
oppression, during the years of her decadence,
she brought forth the flower of her
literature and of her art. We may call the
era of intellectual and artistic development,
or rather inflorescence, by whatever name
we will&mdash;Augustan, Elizabethan, or Victorian&mdash;but
the fact is, the sovereign has no
claim to this distinction, for he or she
merely happened to reign when this took
place.</p>

<p>Thus we find during the reigns of the
three Philips such world-renowned names as
Garcilasso de la Vega, the historian; Las
Casas, Oviedo, Bernal Diaz, and Cortes, military
writers; Cervantes, author of the immortal
Don Quixote; Lope de Vega, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
dramatist, minor poets in great numbers, and
great painters like Murillo, Ribera, and Velasquez.
Titian, even, was a friend of his
patron Charles I, and spent some of his last
years painting portraits for Philip II.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">THE HOUSE OF BOURBON.</p>

<p class="p2">“The king is dead; long live the king!”
Before Charles II passed away, weak and
vacillating as he was, he bequeathed to his
subjects a legacy of woe in the unfruitful
“Wars of the Succession.” Finally, on his
deathbed, through the influence of his confessor,
and at the recommendation of Pope
Innocent II, Charles made a will in favour
of Philip of Anjou, grandson of Louis XIV of
France. When he received the news of this
triumph, for which he had long been scheming,
the French king joyfully exclaimed,
“The Pyrenees no longer exist!” meaning
that from that time France and Spain would
be virtually under one sovereign, that sovereign
himself. This did not actually come
about; but to show how nearly the interests
of the two countries were allied henceforth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
let us examine the ancestry of the new
king.</p>

<p>We have only to note that Philip of Anjou
was the grandson of Louis, who himself was
in early life married to the Infanta Maria
Teresa, daughter of Philip IV, and hence, in
natural course, would have claim to the Spanish
succession in the event of what had now
actually happened&mdash;a King of Spain dying
without an heir of his own issue. But this
event had been anticipated at the time of
their marriage, and Maria Teresa had solemnly
renounced all claim to the throne of
Spain, either for herself or her heirs. This
was because a just fear pervaded other nations
of the two great monarchies with their
dependent territories becoming united under
one sovereign. To preserve the “balance of
power” in Europe, it was considered necessary
that they should be separately governed.</p>

<p>Still, Louis never quite gave up the idea
of a scion of the house of Bourbon sitting on
the throne of Spain, and he was prepared to
sustain that resolve with all the might of his
armies. He hardly dared, however, press the
claims of the dauphin, his and Maria Teresa’s
eldest son, but compromised on the son of
the dauphin, Philip of Anjou. This was in a
certain sense the better policy, for it excited
less opposition from other crowned heads;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and as it happened, the dauphin died before
Louis himself, and Philip long survived him.</p>

<p>The remaining candidate for regal honours,
and who was slighted in the award, was
Leopold, Emperor of Germany, whose mother
was the daughter of Philip III, and who
was also descended from Charles V’s brother
Ferdinand. He at once began a war
against Philip in behalf of his son, the Archduke
Charles, and, being joined by England
and the Netherlands, acting under the “Grand
Alliance,” Europe was again plunged into the
barbarities of senseless warfare.</p>

<p>Philip was seated in 1700, the Alliance was
declared in 1701, and then quickly ensued a
succession of great battles, with victories at
first in favour of the allies, but eventually resulting
in favour of the Bourbon King of Spain.
It was during these Wars of the Succession,
as they were called, that first rose to prominence
the great Duke of Marlborough, who,
in connection with Prince Eugene, won the
famous victory of Blenheim, in 1704. This
was followed by the splendid victory of Ramillies,
in 1706, and by that of Malplaquet, in
1709. In truth, the allies made Louis repent of
ever having undertaken to sustain his grandson
on the throne of Spain, especially as at first
other victories fell to the portion of the archduke,
until nearly all eastern and south-eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Spain acknowledged the pretensions of
“Charles III,” as he styled himself. But
though Philip was twice driven from his capital,
Madrid; though the rich city of Barcelona
was captured by the English, and
the Rock of Gibraltar taken by Sir George
Rooke, in 1704; though the French empire
itself seemed in danger of annihilation, yet
unexpected circumstances intervened to save
both Louis and Philip from destruction.
That is, by the death of the Emperor Joseph,
in 1711, the Archduke Charles received
the imperial crown; and as the powers
never intended that Spain and Germany
should be again united, any more than they
could tolerate the union of France and Spain,
why, they all “turned right about face” and
scampered away from each other as fast as
they could. All this fuss about a crown
would seem ludicrous, were it not for the sanguinary
side of the strife&mdash;the ravaged countries,
the thousands fallen in battle, the towns
and cities burned, the innocent women and
children massacred&mdash;all, that a certain insignificant,
slow-witted hypochondriac named
Philip of Anjou might seat himself upon the
Spanish throne!</p>

<p>By the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, he was
acknowledged King of Spain and the Indies;
but Milan, Naples, the Netherlands, and Sardinia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
were given to the insatiate Louis XIV.
And England, which never yet went into a
war without the ultimate object of territorial
aggrandizement or material profit of some
sort, retained out of the general scramble all
her conquests of Gibraltar, Minorca, Hudson
Bay and Newfoundland, St. Christopher Island
in the West Indies, and Acadia.</p>

<p>Poor Spain, as usual, was plucked of many
of her gaudiest feathers; and thus, after thirteen
years of warfare, she became blessed with
a prince of the house of Bourbon instead of one
of the house of Hapsburg; the only difference
between the two being that one was French,
the other Austrian, and neither with more
than a trace of Spanish blood to substantiate
a claim to the throne of Isabella and Ferdinand.</p>

<p>Woefully had Spain descended in the scale
of nations, and basely had she mingled her
blood with foreign elements, until she could
no longer claim as a ruler one nearly allied
to the proud nobles of Castile or Aragon.
She only knew that a degenerate Bourbon had
replaced an equally degenerate Hapsburg; but
she must have loved the foreigner greatly, for
a descendant of the Bourbon sits on the throne
of Spain to-day.</p>

<p>In justice to Philip V&mdash;to give him his
new title&mdash;it may be said that Spain has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
been less wisely ruled than she was by him.
The death of his imperial grandfather, in 1715,
tempted him to break his pledges at the
Treaty of Utrecht and aspire to the throne of
France; but England’s fleets and the “Quadruple
Alliance” soon brought him to his
senses, and he abandoned all thoughts of a
dual empire.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the country was not yet entirely
drained of its resources; its people had
still a little vitality remaining, and after a
reign of forty-six years Philip left his kingdom
in rather better condition than he had
found it. Having still half the world tributary
to that kingdom, the colonies of America,
continually pouring into the Spanish
treasury the golden products of mine and
soil, the country needed only peace to enable
it to recuperate. This period of rest it found
during the reign of Philip’s successor and
son, Ferdinand VI, who entered upon the
kingly state at the death of his father, in
1746.</p>

<p>As so frequently happens, the best king
has the shortest reign, and Ferdinand lived
but thirteen years after falling heir to the
crown. But these were years of tranquility
and progress, during which impoverished
Spain deigned to take stock of her own resources
and did not go abroad to rob her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
neighbours. Internal improvements were
carried out, roads and canals built, agriculture
fostered, oppressive taxes equalized,
ship-building and foreign trade encouraged.
The nucleus of a navy was gathered, and at
the end of this reign it consisted of more than
eighty frigates and ships of the line, valued
at sixty million dollars.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, the Church was
the greatest enemy of the people&mdash;at least,
of the people’s material welfare. In the time
of Ferdinand VI it had a revenue of three
hundred and fifty-nine million dollars, which
was greater than that of the state, and there
were one hundred and eighty thousand clerical
or non-producing people connected with
it. The king did not interfere with its liberties,
but he took steps to limit the power of
the Pope, so that indiscriminate appointments
were prevented; and he hindered the work
of the Inquisition so much that it had but ten
victims during his reign, as against one thousand
during the reign of his father, and was,
at last, almost starved out!</p>

<p>By the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748,
the War of the Austrian Succession, into which
Philip V had been drawn, was brought to a
close and the heroic Maria Theresa confirmed
in her rights. And though there was danger
of trouble with England, over the “<i>asiento</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>,”
it was obviated by concessions from Spain to
the former’s great advantage. This <i>asiento</i>&mdash;literally
a contract&mdash;was a special agreement
by which the ships of England were entitled
to trade to a certain extent with Spanish
colonies, those of other nations being prohibited,
especially in negro slaves from Africa.</p>

<p>The Seven Years’ War, which broke out
in 1756 between Prussia and England on one
hand, and Austria, France, and Sweden on the
other, was a severe strain upon Spain’s neutrality,
for both sides sought her aid. Ferdinand,
however, wisely abstained from war,
even though Pitt, the great English minister,
offered him back Gibraltar, to reconquer
which Spain had fought desperately and besieged
in vain, with the assistance of the
French. He still remained neutral, and Gibraltar
yet rears its defiant crest under the
folds of Britain’s flag.</p>

<p>Ferdinand’s beloved consort died in 1758,
and, unlike his father in similar circumstances,
he did not console himself with another, but
sincerely mourned the good Barbara of Portugal,
and was faithful to her memory until his
own demise the following year. Altogether,
Ferdinand’s reign was in such beneficent
contrast to others which had preceded it that
we could wish it had been prolonged. It was
to his able ministers, Enseñada and Carvajal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
that the country was indebted for so much;
but as the king would have been held accountable
had they been evil counsellors, so he is
entitled to credit for following their advice.</p>

<p>And so, when his successor and brother,
Charles III, took possession of the throne, he
was most agreeably surprised to find&mdash;what
had not occurred before since Isabella’s time&mdash;a
surplus in the treasury! To be sure,
much of it, if not all, was due to the fact that
the national debt had not been paid for many
years; but still the credit of it belongs to the
frugal Ferdinand. When Charles III came to
the throne, in 1759, he brought with him an
invaluable experience of a twenty-five-years’
reign as King of Naples. In the main, he followed
in Ferdinand’s footsteps, yet in 1762 he
joined with France in the “family compact,”
by which the Bourbons engaged to support
each other against all others, and this precipitated
the war with England, in which, as
usual, Britain came out with the lion’s share
of territory. Havana in Cuba, Trinidad, Manila,
and the famed Acapulco galleon with
three million dollars, besides other immense
booty estimated at fifteen million dollars, fell
into the hands of the English. By the treaty
of peace, 1763, Spain got back her principal
ports only by ceding Florida to the English,
and the valuable rights for cutting logwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
on the Honduras coast, while France gave up
Canada, the Louisiana territory east of the
Mississippi, and several islands in the West
Indies.</p>

<p>Charles had able ministers in the persons
of Squilaci, Grimaldi, Campomanes, and the
Count de Aranda, under the last of whom was
consummated the expulsion of the Jesuits
from Spain, in March, 1767. Their order was
suppressed by Pope Clement XIV, in 1773.
Succeeding Aranda came Don José Moñino,
afterward Count of Floridablanca, as prime
minister. He was in power when the American
colonies of Great Britain declared their
independence, and, like France, sided with
the colonies&mdash;not because of love for them
or sympathy with their aims, but because of
an apparent opportunity offering for striking
a blow at England through her colonial possessions.</p>

<p>An insurrection in Peru, guided by the
Inca, Tupac Amaru, had to be crushed, but
Spain joined with France in a desperate attempt
to retake Gibraltar, and in naval demonstrations,
with the customary results: that
they were repulsed from the Great Rock, and
their fleets destroyed or scattered, particularly
in the West Indies. In 1783, at the
Peace of Versailles, at which the independence
of the United States was established, Florida<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and Minorca were restored to Spain, but the
loss her navy had sustained was irreparable.</p>

<p>In 1786 a peace was declared between
Spain and Algiers, by which thousands of
Spanish captives were released from slavery,
and the piratical incursions from which the
coast country had long suffered were ended.
Two years later Charles III passed away, at
the age of seventy-three, having done much
to earn the gratitude of his country.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">CHARLES IV AND BONAPARTE.</p>

<p class="pc2">When, at the age of forty, in 1789, Charles
IV ascended the throne of Spain, he for a while
retained in power his father’s great prime
minister, Floridablanca; but soon, it seems,
his wisdom failed him. After dallying awhile
with this faithful servant, who was succeeded
by Count Cabarrus, then by the patriot Jovellanos,
Charles gave up all attempts to rule
wisely, and abandoned himself utterly to the
guidance of his wife, who was as capricious
and depraved as any of her sex who had ever
before ruled over a Spanish king. In 1792
the queen managed to install her own favourite,
Manuel Godoy, a young man of low
birth, in the seat of the statesman Aranda,
and had him raised to the rank of a Spanish
grandee, as Duke of Alcudia. Henceforth,
for many years, poor Spain was to witness the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
humiliating spectacle of a good-natured but
weak sovereign, ruled by his vicious wife and
her creature, and to become familiar with family
scandals which were a disgrace to the
nation.</p>

<p>Perhaps Charles would have made mistakes
enough if he had been left to himself,
for early in his reign the world was amazed
at the horrible cruelties of the French Revolution,
and he, as a Bourbon allied to the family
of Louis XVI, was placed in a most embarrassing
position when the excesses of the
revolutionists culminated in the execution of
the king. All Spain rose in protest against
this barbarous act, and urged King Charles
to declare for vengeance; but he sat supinely
in his palace, and did nothing more than to
send a feeble protest and a feebler army
against the regicides. The new-born republic
did not wait, however, for him to declare war,
but sent a force into Spain, which quickly
invaded the frontier and soon defeated the
allied Spanish and Portuguese in several
battles. The triumphant republicans were
only checked when they held the peninsula at
their mercy, for, as history has told us, they
were at the outset invincible. They snatched
victories from defeats, turned defeats into
victories: these desperate outlaws, battling
against the rights of kings and the oppressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of a decadent nobility. They were
equally victorious over the allied armies in
the Netherlands also, and soon we have the
edifying spectacle of this Bourbon King of
Spain entering into treaty with the red-handed
murderers of his royal kinsman. This was in
1795, at the Treaty of Basel, arranged by the
vainglorious Godoy, who won thereby great
rewards in lands and honours, and also the
title of the “Prince of Peace.” Further, by the
Treaty of Ildefonso, in 1796, distracted Spain
turned completely around and entered into an
offensive and defensive alliance with France
against England. Retribution was swift and
sure, for the next year her fleet was shattered
at the naval fight of Cape St. Vincent, Cadiz
was attacked by the English, and she lost the
island of Trinidad in the West Indies, besides
having her merchant marine ruined and her
colonial trade all but destroyed.</p>

<p>At the instigation of Napoleon, who was
now foremost in the affairs of France, Spain
declared war against her sister kingdom,
Portugal, though sorely against her will, as&mdash;if
for no other reason&mdash;the queen’s favourite
daughter, Carlota, was the wife of the
Prince Regent of Portugal. But in 1801 that
kingdom was overrun by an army composed of
seventy-five thousand men, fifteen thousand
of which were French and sixty thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Spanish, and the “Prince of Peace” won new
honours for himself by his active participation.
Spain, in common with other European countries,
secured a brief breathing space by the
Treaty of Amiens, in 1802, but by this treaty
England was confirmed in her captures and
came out triumphant.</p>

<p>Napoleon’s act in disposing of Louisiana
to the United States for the paltry sum of
fifteen million dollars, was a vast benefit to
America, but a violation of good faith, inasmuch
as Spain had ceded that territory to
France, only three years before, with the
expressed condition that no other country
should ever obtain it. Still, she meekly bore
this bitter humiliation, for she was under the
domination of the conqueror of Europe, who
soon imposed yet heavier conditions upon
her. He found a pretext for violating the
peace with England, and Spain also, who had
purchased her neutrality by a monthly payment,
in 1804 declared war against the Britons
for seizing her homeward-sailing galleons
with their wealth of treasure from the American
colonies. England had done this as
a measure of self-defence, foreseeing that,
with the sinews of war which this colonial
treasure would purchase, Spain would not
hesitate to cast her lot with Napoleon and
France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>The conflict that ensued put an end forever
(so far as human ken can forecast) to
Spain’s ascendancy at sea. Her supremacy,
indeed, had long since departed; not
since the times of the “invincible armada”
had she been a powerful factor to reckon with
upon the ocean. But it was during the war
that followed that the combined French and
Spanish fleets, under Villeneuve and Gravina,
were sought out and attacked by Lord
Nelson. Off Trafalgar, October 25, 1805, occurred
that memorable naval battle by which
the fleets were shattered, and England obtained,
coincidently with the death of Nelson,
the title which she has since so proudly borne,
of “mistress of the seas.” She was thenceforth
supreme upon the ocean, and the colonies
of France and Spain were at her mercy.</p>

<p>The Spanish-French alliance had changed
since the time of the “family compact,” for
what then was a natural union between sovereigns
allied by blood and interests, was now
a most unnatural connection between two
totally dissimilar organizations. Especially
since Napoleon had so cruelly put to death the
young Duke d’Enghien, a scion of the Bourbon
house in 1804, Spain regarded France
with averted eyes. The repugnance of the
king could not be overcome, and even the
skill at dissimulation possessed by the artful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Godoy could not suffice to hide from Napoleon
the fact that his great adversary, England,
was higher in favour than himself. He
took a characteristic revenge, and by compelling
Spain to become a party to the dismemberment
of Portugal, by the Treaty of
Fontainebleau, placed her in a position from
which she could not retreat. This was in
1806, and the same year a French army under
Junot invaded Portugal and drove the royal
family into exile. The next year, however, it
became evident that not Portugal alone, but
Spain as well, was the object of the great Napoleon’s
ambition. The wonder is that she
had escaped so long, when already Germany,
Italy, Austria, Prussia, the Netherlands, and
even the vast empire of Russia, had been invaded
by him and made subject to his will.
But Spain’s hour had come; the giant now felt
the moment propitious for her conquest. Under
pretext of marching his troops through
Spain to Portugal&mdash;as by the treaty he was
permitted to do&mdash;Napoleon massed his soldiers
at all the passes of the Pyrenees, and,
before the king and court were well aware of
his plans, had obtained full possession of the
frontier, and was sending forward Murat and
his battalions to the capital, Madrid. Terror-stricken,
the royal family resolved at
once to flee to Mexico. But when the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
learned this, realizing that all this misery
had been brought upon them by the corrupt
and faithless Godoy, they rose <i>en masse</i> and
sacked the palace, seeking everywhere for
the prime minister, whose life would have
been forfeited if he had not escaped by hiding
in a closet. This ebullition showed
Charles IV the futility of longer clinging
to the shadow of what he had formerly possessed,
and he formally abdicated, on March
17, 1808, in favour of his son Ferdinand, the
Prince of Asturias.</p>

<p>France had experienced her Reign of Terror;
she now had her master, Napoleon, who
looked upon his small empire as too restricted
for his towering ambitions, and cast around
for some other thrones to occupy. He saw,
with that clearness of perception for which
he was noted, that the throne of Spain was
divided against itself: the king against the
queen, Godoy the Prince of Peace against
them both, and the son of the king at enmity
with the other three. In truth, it was charged
by Godoy that he had conspired to kill, or
at least to dethrone, his father, and he was
thrown into prison until he pretended to relent
and ask forgiveness. Ferdinand, hated
by his mother, despised by the prime minister,
and accustomed to regard his father
as an obstacle in the path of his ambition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
was an altogether unlovely character, dark,
sinister, with the making of another Philip II
in him, had but the times been propitious.
He was, however, the popular idol, and the
misguided people hailed with joy this new
accession to the line of royalty, under the
title of Ferdinand VII.</p>

<p>It was not long that he was permitted to
enjoy the royal prerogatives, nor the malicious
satisfaction of retaliating upon his enemies.
Confiding in the supposed friendship
of Napoleon, he sent back to Portugal the
Spanish troops which his father had recalled
in anticipation of a French invasion, and unsuspiciously
placed himself in the emperor’s
hands. With consummate duplicity, Bonaparte
allured first Ferdinand, then his father,
the queen mother and Godoy, over the frontier
to Bayonne, where he indeed had them
at his mercy, and then revealed his true intentions.
In a word, he frightened Ferdinand
into an abdication, his father into renouncing
forever his claim to the throne, in return for
a pension and paltry honours, and Godoy he
dropped as unworthy of attention.</p>

<p>Ferdinand was promised an income of
one million francs, a palace, and&mdash;captivity.
Meanwhile, Napoleon called an assembly of
the notables&mdash;such as would come at his call&mdash;forced
upon them a new Constitution, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
made them swear allegiance to the new king,
who, of course, was one of his own family&mdash;his
brother Joseph, until then King of Naples.
Joseph himself, by nature unfitted for kingship,
amiable, humane, was yet unable to resist
his imperious brother. Against his own
inclinations he was forced to take the throne;
but not all the ability and resources of Napoleon
could keep him seated there. For
though Napoleon, after he had finished this
work to his mind&mdash;had dethroned two kings
and seated another&mdash;returned to Paris and
other victories, yet the people over whom he
had placed his brother Joseph absolutely refused
to accept him. An outbreak at Madrid
was only quelled after many French soldiers
and Spanish citizens had been massacred, and
affairs wore such a threatening aspect that re-enforcements
now poured through the Pyrenean
passes to the number of one hundred
thousand men. Marat did the best he could,
other French generals co-operated; but within
a week or so after he had entered the Spanish
capital, Joseph was compelled to retreat to
the frontier.</p>

<p class="p2">These, in brief, were the beginnings of
the famed Peninsular War, which lasted from
1807 to 1814, and inflicted incalculable misery
upon the Spanish and Portuguese people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
The Spanish fought desperately, but without
common purpose or direction. At the first
siege of Saragossa, made memorable by the
valiant defence of its inhabitants, Palafox and
the romantic “Maid of Saragossa,” the French
were repulsed; but at the second they took
the city, with terrible slaughter. Joseph was
a second time compelled to abandon Madrid,
and a second time to return; for his brother
was furious over the acts of the Spanish rebels,
and determined to subdue the country.
Perhaps he would have accomplished this in
the end, though the whole nation was now
aroused; but the Spaniards bethought themselves
to appeal to England for assistance.
The British ministry saw its way clear to
fight the universal conqueror in Spain and
Portugal in a manner not possible on the soil
of France; so they sent out Moore and Wellington,
and other tried generals, with armies
behind them and fleets to support them, and
they began operations in Portugal. At first
they were successful in compelling Marshal
Ney to evacuate Portugal; but in Spain Sir
John Moore was driven back upon the port
of Coruña, and met his death&mdash;the same General
Moore whose defeat and burial are immortalized
in heroic verse. Napoleon himself
hastened to Spain and organized victories
with two hundred thousand men, so that for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
a time “brother Joseph” was secure on the
throne upon which his imperial master had so
unceremoniously seated him. But with his
departure reverses came again; for, though
driven away at first, the British returned.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">THE REIGN OF FERDINAND VII.</p>

<p class="p2">The same month of July, 1808, in which
Joseph Bonaparte was proclaimed King of
Spain at Madrid, the British troops were
despatched to Portugal. After Junot had
been expelled from that kingdom the genius
of Napoleon reorganized his armies, until the
French in Spain numbered not less than four
hundred thousand men, which he left divided
into eight corps under as many generals and
marshals. Soult invaded Portugal, and was
promptly driven out by Wellington; while
King Joseph, with eighty thousand men, was
defeated at Talavera, July, 1809. During the
ensuing winter Wellington constructed that
famous line of earthworks, twenty-nine miles
in length, known as the lines of Torres Vedras.
The French had then captured every
city of note in southern Spain except Cadiz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and Wellington foresaw the necessity of preparing
an impregnable base for retreat, in case
he was pursued by the overwhelmingly powerful
forces of the enemy. His foresight was
justified when General Massena, with sixty-five
thousand soldiers, moved against him in
the spring of 1810. He retreated slowly behind
his lines of defence, taking with him all
the available sustenance of the country, and
Massena, unable to force the works, and in
effect starved out, after losing thirty thousand
men, sullenly retreated northward. Following
him cautiously, the English general,
in the spring of 1811, overtook and whipped
him in a battle fought in April, and for the
third time rid Portugal of the French invaders.
After this, by a succession of skilfully
planned battles, and with victory alternating
defeat, Wellington persistently advanced,
until in August, 1812, he entered Madrid.
He had not yet accomplished his purpose,
however, of ridding Spain of the French, who
still had nearly two hundred thousand men in
the field. He was compelled to retire again
in the direction of his protecting earthworks;
but in the spring of 1813, finding himself
now commander-in-chief of an army of two
hundred thousand men, seventy thousand of
whom were Anglo-Portuguese veterans, Wellington
advanced boldly northward, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Vittoria, on the 21st of June, met and overwhelmingly
defeated the French under King
Joseph, who fled from the field “with a ‘Napoleon’
(coin) in his pocket, and leaving another
Napoleon in a predicament.” After that,
Wellington’s advance was an almost uninterrupted
series of victories, until, by February,
1814, he was well over the frontier and investing
cities on the soil of France. But by
that time Bonaparte himself was a fugitive,
having abdicated, and the capital of France
was in possession of the allied armies.</p>

<p>In this manner did the British fight the
battles of Spain and drive from her soil the
armies of France. It was not altogether a
disinterested task, of course, but a sagacious
move of the highest diplomacy, for, as England’s
ministry had foreseen, Spain became
the “grave of France.” By continually weakening
his armies to accomplish her conquest,
Napoleon only paved the way for the complete
triumph of his enemies in the north:
the allied forces of Prussia, Russia, and Austria.
Wellington received great rewards
from his own country, and Spain eventually
bestowed upon him vast estates, which his descendants
own to-day. Here, also, he first met
and checked the great conqueror of Europe;
and he utilized the invaluable experience of
this five-years’ war the next summer, when, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the field of Waterloo, he finally crushed Napoleon,
and drove him into eventual exile at
St. Helena. He may truly be called the saviour
of Spain, for, aside from a few detached battles
and a desultory though persistent guerrilla
warfare, the Spaniards conducted no wise
scheme of defence. The battle of Vittoria
shows the relative parts played by them and
their allies, when their total loss was but 553,
the Portuguese 1,049, and the English 3,308.
This was the end of the great “Napoleonic
storm cloud” that burst over distracted Europe
and shattered against the Spanish Pyrenees.</p>

<p class="p2">“The unfortunate war in Spain was the
first cause of the misfortunes of France,”
wrote the exiled Napoleon years afterward,
when in St. Helena. His first step, after he
found it impossible to retain Joseph on the
Spanish throne, was to treat with Ferdinand,
still a prisoner, in December, 1813. But before
he could return the latter to his country
he himself was deposed, and another Bourbon,
Louis XVIII, had entered Paris as the
choice of the allied conquerors.</p>

<p>Amid universal ovations Ferdinand assumed
his intermitted reign, first promising
to support the liberal Constitution which the
Cortes presented for his acceptance. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Spaniards had spent more time in framing a
Constitution than in fighting, and this guarantee
of the people’s rights was a very liberal
instrument&mdash;on paper. If Ferdinand
had kept his pledges to sustain it, his would
have been a very limited instead of the very
absolute monarchy it was. But he did not
keep his word, for the Inquisition, which had
been abolished, was restored; the Jesuits
were recalled; and of the liberal statesmen,
who had at heart the good of Spain, some
were sent to the galleys, and others executed.
In fact, the despicable Ferdinand had learned
nothing in his exile; a true Bourbon, he was
at perpetual enmity with the people and republican
institutions. Yet his countrymen
had recalled him, supported him in power,
and bared their necks to the naked sword of
his despotism. The ignorant masses certainly
ruled in Spain when Ferdinand VII, “worst
of the Bourbon kings,” came back to his own.
But even fools have feelings, and some of
them rose against him in 1822, and he, true
to his Bourbon instincts, called to his aid the
Holy Alliance. French troops under the Duc
d’Angoulême, to the number of one hundred
and fifty thousand, came pouring into the peninsula,
and stayed there five years, until the
base monarch’s hold upon his throne was
fixed again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Bolstered by foreign troops, Ferdinand
gave vent to his brutal instincts by imprisoning
thousands of his subjects who had
ventured to protest against this incarnation
of corruption and venality; he executed the
leaders, banished others, and perpetrated
atrocities such as he delighted in.</p>

<p>His most beneficent act toward his harried
kingdom was the involuntary deliverance
afforded by his death; but even then he
left a legacy of civil war, that has lasted to
the present time.</p>

<p>Like his great predecessor, Philip II,
whom he so much resembled, he married
thrice, his last wife being his niece (as was
Philip’s), Maria Christina, daughter of the
King of Naples. Hitherto childless, Ferdinand
was delighted, on the 18th of October,
1830, at the birth of a daughter to Queen
Christina. It was her birth that inaugurated
the civil wars to which reference has been
made, and of which we will treat in the following
chapter.</p>

<p>Momentous events happened during the
reign of Ferdinand VII, which reduced his
kingdom from a world-embracing dominance
almost to the confines of the Iberian Peninsula.
When, in the first decade of this century,
the Emperor of France turned his greedy
eyes toward Spain, she possessed territory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
now included in Florida, Mexico, Central
America, all South America save Brazil; the
islands of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and a portion
of Santo Domingo in the West Indies, besides
the Carolines and Philippines in the East,
and her present possessions on and near the
western coast of Africa and in the Mediterranean.
When it was seen by her colonies
that Spain was too weak to resist the imposition
of a foreigner upon her throne, their
bolder spirits realized that the moment had
arrived for deliverance from her oppressions.
The standard of revolt was raised in Mexico,
1808; in Venezuela, 1810; Buenos Ayres,
Chili, and Peru followed the movement,
until, before the death of Ferdinand, every
American colony and every island had been
lost to Spain except Cuba and Puerto Rico.
Long and sanguinary were the struggles between
the desperate Spaniards and the aspirants
for freedom; but in the end the patriots
conquered, and continental America was
freed from Spanish misrule. Florida was
ceded in 1819 to the United States, which
ultimately acquired a vast portion of Mexican
territory by conquest and treaty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">ISABELLA II AND THE CARLISTS.</p>

<p class="p2">The greatest, most illustrious reigns in
Spain have been those inaugurated by the
placing on the throne of princes already of
age, trained in kingly affairs and able to
rule without assistance. The weakest, most
deplorable reigns have been those where
princes or princesses nominally occupied the
throne, and regencies or successions of favourites
actually held the power. A king or
queen should be one pre-eminent for strength
and virtues, a leader, a ruler, capable of
guiding and fostering the best interests of
the subject people. But the Spaniards,
through their false notions of chivalry, their
romantic ideas of majesty, have lost sight of
the primal principles of kingship. Provided
that a fantastic figure be elevated to the august
position&mdash;whether a weak and juvenile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
scion of royalty, or a gilded and bedizened
puppet of rags and putty&mdash;it may for a time
command their worship and blind adoration!
This national trait is admirable, were nothing
expected of a king or queen but to act
as an ornamental figure-head. Unfortunately,
in a nation composed of such diverse
and irreconcilable elements as exist in Spain,
much more is expected&mdash;is demanded.</p>

<p>When, in 1833, at the death of the king,
the infanta, Maria Isabella II, was held up
for the adoration of the people, most of them
fell down and blindly worshipped. The
Cortes assembled at Madrid and swore loyalty
to the three-year-old queen and her
mother, the regent, while the unthinking people
went wild in their fervent declarations of
devotedness to the heiress of the most corrupt,
most intolerant sovereign that had disgraced
the throne in many years.</p>

<p>But there was an instant protest from a
minor portion of the people, led by the late
king’s brother, Don Maria Isidor Carlos de
Bourbon; not because of the silly spectacle
afforded by placing the reins of power in the
hands of a puling infant, but because Don
Maria Isidor Carlos de Bourbon wanted the
throne for himself! In truth, but for King
Ferdinand’s “pragmatic sanction,” abrogating
the existing “Salic law” (excluding females<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
from the succession), Don Carlos had every
reason to believe he would himself be king.
He was born in 1788, or a year before the
“pragmatic sanction” was put forth, he was
next in line of the male successors, and he
meant to “succeed.” So he started a revolution,
and thus began, in 1833, the first of
that long series of battles, massacres, outrages,
known collectively as the “Carlist
Wars.”</p>

<p>Don Carlos had been banished by Ferdinand
to Portugal for venturing to protest
against the very thing that happened later,
and after the king’s death he came over the
frontier between France and Spain with a
small army. His chief adherents were found
in the country of the Basques, those brave,
peculiar, liberty-loving but bigoted people
in the north of Spain, who have dwelt from
time immemorial in their beautiful mountain
valleys, and whom we have noted at the very
beginnings of Spanish history as strenuous
opponents of oppression and defenders of
their rights, real or imaginary.</p>

<p>Among other rights which they claimed
were the ancient <i>fueros</i>&mdash;charters or privileges&mdash;by
which, in consideration of valiant
services in the past, they were exempt from
most taxes, from enforced military service,
etc., and they recognised the ruler of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
country not as king or queen, but merely
as lord. It was given out by the Carlists
that these <i>fueros</i> were to be taken from
them by the “liberals,” or adherents to the
queen regent, and that only by assisting the
really legitimate sovereign (Don Carlos, of
course) could they still continue to enjoy
their ancient immunities. So they flocked to
the Carlist standard, and opposed to them
and their associates were the <i>Christinos</i>, or
supporters of the queen regent Christina.
For seven years they fought, victory first
with one side, then with the other. At one
time the queen regent and her court were on
the point of fleeing the country; the Carlist
guerrillas were at the gates of Madrid; but
by the persistence of General Espartero,
commander of the Christinos, in May, 1840,
the last of the pretender’s forces were driven
over the frontier. Terrible excesses were
committed on both sides; the Carlists, particularly,
under the savage Cabrera and Zumalacarregui,
showed what the Spaniard is
capable of when his evil passions are aroused.
“Those days that I do not shed blood,” said
the cruel Cabrera, “I do not have a good digestion!”
He punished with death the giving
of a drink of water to a wounded enemy,
and he butchered in cold blood numerous
innocent women, children, and aged men. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Christino garrison once surrendered to him
on the stipulation that their lives and their
clothes should be spared to them. He performed
his part by stripping them of their
clothing and setting his men to chasing and
shooting them until the last one fell! And
these conflicts were between men of the
same nationality, sometimes of the same
township and canton; thus showing to what
a state of moral degradation these people
had arrived.</p>

<p>A short period of peace ensued, but the
Carlist conflict has been continued intermittently
until the present day. The first Don
Carlos died in 1855, and his eldest son, the
Count of Montemolin, fell heir to the feud,
making an unsuccessful attempt at revolution
in Valencia in 1860; but died in 1861.
A brother succeeded to the claims as Juan
III, and he, in 1863, renounced them in favour
of his son, grandson of the first Don Carlos,
or Charles V. He is the present Don Carlos,
or Charles VII, known as the Duke of Madrid,
and was born in 1848. He was implicated
in Carlist uprisings in 1869, 1870, and
1872, and personally instituted his greatest
campaign in 1873, which was suppressed, while
the Basques, his devoted adherents, were deprived
of many privileges. As a French “legitimist,”
he has also a claim to the throne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of France, and was at one time expelled from
that country; but has since been permitted
to return, whence he has conducted clandestine
operations against the Spanish crown.
And now, with a child sovereign and a queen
regent again in Spain, the conditions are similar
to what they were in 1833. There is still,
after more than sixty years, a Don Carlos
as claimant to the throne; but to-day, even
more than then, the moral influence of Europe
is against the “pretender,” and in favour
of the “legitimate” sovereign.</p>

<p>The present queen regent, Christina of
Austria, mother of the boy king Alfonso XIII,
possesses&mdash;what Queen-Regent Christina of
Naples did not have&mdash;the respect and confidence
of her people. Christina of Naples,
the mother of Isabella, forfeited the good
opinion of all her subjects by her gross immorality,
and in 1840 she was compelled to
renounce her regency in favour of the prime
minister, Espartero, who as general of her
armies had won the victories over the Carlists,
and leave the country. Her daughter,
as Isabella II, was early declared to have
reached her majority, and in 1846 was married
to her cousin, Don Francisco de Bourbon,
while her sister, the infanta, was married
to the Duke of Montpensier, son of Louis
Philippe of France. These were the infamous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
“Spanish marriages” arranged by Louis
Philippe in the hope of securing the succession
to his house.</p>

<p>The story of her reign is not an inviting
one, revealing as it does the instability of
the Spanish character and the corruption
of the court and queen. Spain’s foreign
relations had been strengthened by the
“Quadruple Alliance” between England,
France, Portugal, and Spain, and liberal
statesmen were numerous who would have
served her faithfully. Under Burgos, in
Christina’s time, wise plans were made for
the development of commerce, internal improvements,
and the regulation of church
and state. Blindly cognizant that the church
had in some way possessed itself of a vast
portion of the nation’s wealth, many advocated
confiscation of church properties. In
1835 the cry was, “Down with the monks!”
and hundreds of these helpless though useless
persons were massacred. The country’s
resources seemed at the last ebb, when the
able banker Mendizabel came to the rescue;
but he accomplished no more than the several
“Constitutions” (of which at least three were
put forth in twenty-five years) to remedy
the existing troubles. The reason was that
the real secret of their troubles lay in the
people themselves: the masses, complacent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
in self-sufficient ignorance; the intelligent
portion without patriotism, self-seeking politicians.</p>

<p>Espartero was overthrown and went into
exile in 1843. In 1844 arose a strong military
government under the veteran Narvaez,
who kept order and sustained the throne
until 1851. Meanwhile the French Revolution
of 1848, though it unsettled Spain not
a little, was safely tided over. In 1854 insurrections
broke out in various parts of the
country, and to appease the people a national
“Junta” was formed, with the recalled Espartero
and O’Donnell at its head. The latter
continued to direct affairs more or less
until 1858; in 1859 he created a diversion of
public sentiment by a short war in Morocco,
and in 1861 the island of Santo Domingo was
annexed.</p>

<p>Between this time and 1866 the changes
in the ministry were numerous, from O’Donnell
to Miraflores, and back again to Narvaez
and O’Donnell; but in 1866 a serious insurrection
under General Prim broke out, which
was suppressed and the leaders exiled. A
more successful rebellion was inaugurated in
1868 by the naval fleet under Admiral Topete,
at Cadiz. Prim and Serrano, the exiles,
returned; the rebels and royal troops fraternized,
and Queen Isabella, then at the baths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of San Sebastian, was sent over the frontier,
never to return.</p>

<p>Without being specific in charges against
her, it may be mentioned that her subjects,
debased as many of them were, yet demanded
a queen with higher moral purpose&mdash;more like
the Isabella of old, less like the disreputable
queen-mother Christina. She had reigned,
in a fashion, for thirty-five years, including
the regency. She was banished in 1868, since
which time she has lived in Paris, where she
made her home after her exile, ever true to
the traditions of Ferdinand VII and his times.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">FROM ISABELLA II TO ALFONSO XIII.</p>

<p>“A daughter of kings: if I were a man
I would go to my capital!” indignantly declared
Isabella, when the appalling news
reached her that the royal army was defeated.
But instead, she sought safety in
flight, leaving to the successful revolutionists
the difficult task of providing a government
in place of the one they had overthrown.
Distrust and suspicion were rampant, and
those who had declared the <i>pronunciamiento</i>
were at their wits’ ends what to choose: a
democratic monarchy, a constitutional monarchy,
or a republic; but during the interregnum
the patriot Serrano stepped into the
breach. A thankless task was his, as president
of the provisional government, though
he was assisted by such able men as Prim,
Minister of War; Topete, Minister of Marine;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Zorilla, Minister of Commerce; Figuerola, of
Finance; Ortiz, of Justice; Lopez de Ayala,
of the Colonies; and Sagasta, Minister of the
Interior.</p>

<p>They were glad to resign, the following
year, and subscribe to a constitution which
provided for the restoration of a constitutional
monarchy.</p>

<p>The constitutional monarchy was very
beautiful, as an idea; but while Serrano ruled
as “regent for the interregnum,” the throne
of Spain “went begging about Europe,” seeking
a royal occupant. General Prim was insistent
upon the candidacy of Prince Leopold,
of Hohenzollern, a relative of King William
of Prussia, at which Napoleon III took
alarm; and though the prince promptly resigned
his candidature, the French emperor
demanded further that Prussia should give
a guarantee that she would at no future time
sanction his claims. King William refused
to give this assurance, and Napoleon made
this a pretext for declaring that war against
Prussia which ended so disastrously for his
empire and for France.</p>

<p>Isabella’s brother-in-law, the Duke of
Montpensier, as well as Fernando of Portugal,
were considered, but rejected for political
reasons; and even sturdy old Espartero
refused the crown, showing the possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
greater wisdom than the one upon whom it
was finally bestowed&mdash;Don Amadeo, Duke
of Aosta, the second son of Victor Emanuel
of Italy.</p>

<p>The reception he received was presaged
by the assassination of Prim, in December,
1870; but Amadeo was crowned a few days
later, on January 2, 1871, and entered heartily
into the duties of his unsought kingship.
Two years later, after having been several
times the object of assassination and of insults
innumerable, he became convinced that
modern Spain was different from that Spain
which had besought a foreign prince to rule
over it in the eighteenth century, and sorrowfully
abdicated.</p>

<p>Monarchical rule having failed them, the
Spaniards now turned to a republic, as the
ideal toward which they had striven through
these hopeless, turbulent, and chaotic years.
But they did not take into account their inborn
reverence for a king, their superstitious
faith in the sanctity of the royal office; and
so the “republic” had a thorny road to travel,
first under Señor Pi y Margall, the first
“president of the executive power,” lastly
under the great jurist, orator, and patriot,
Emilio Castelar.</p>

<p>Away back in the time of the regent
Christina, that queen was troubled by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
dissensions of the so-called liberals, who,
split into two parties, the <i>moderados</i> and the
<i>progresistas</i>, impeded whatever advance might
have been possible had the occupant of the
throne been inclined toward the people.</p>

<p>So now, the actual arrival of the republic
found dissensions among the very “patriots”
who should have served it disinterestedly
and with fervour. The misnamed “republic”
served but as a bridge for another king to
pass over from exile to the throne.</p>

<p>When Prim was dying, mortally wounded
by unknown assassins, he whispered to a
friend, “I die, but your king is coming!”
The king came, and went; the “republic”
came, and went out in the <i>coup-d’état</i> of January,
1874, with militarism triumphant, and
the administration of the government in the
hands of military officers. Their action in
putting down anarchy and ending the civil
war&mdash;for “Don Carlos” had again taken the
field, with his Basque retainers, in support
of his inalienable “male succession”&mdash;would
seem to prove that Spain, like Mexico, needed
the mailed hand of the military dictator to
force it into paths of prosperity and development.</p>

<p>Serrano might have been that dictator;
but if he had designs, they did not succeed,
for he soon resigned in favour of one who proclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
himself “the first republican in Europe”&mdash;no
less a personage than the seventeen-year-old
son of Isabella the exile, who
was ferreted out by the king-makers and
offered the crown, that a Bourbon might
again occupy the throne of his ancestors.</p>

<p>The Spaniards were now content, for had
they not travelled the road of republicanism
and found it a failure? tried the rule of a
foreigner, and found him wanting? At last
they were in possession of their own again!
In his veins ran the blood of Isabella the
corrupt; but his reputed father was an amiable
man, and so was the new king, Alfonso
XII, who was proclaimed at Madrid in January,
1875.</p>

<p>The faults, the traits, of Alfonso XII were
inherited. Even his death, less than eleven
years after his coronation, is said to have
been caused by constitutional ills. But, so
far as he could, he nobly lived up to his intentions
to give Spain peace and renewed
prosperity. Six years before the people had
shouted, “Away with the Bourbons!” yet
here again was a Bourbon on the throne.
He could not forget the line from which he
descended, nor the treatment his mother, also
a Bourbon, had received; yet his reign approached
what the people had so long desired.
Able ministers assisted him, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
humour of the hour: first under General Martinez
Campos; then under the leadership of
Canovas del Castillo; again under the liberal
Señor Sagasta. Through all these changes,
however, Alfonso preserved the goodwill of
his subjects; yet he was the object of the
base assassin’s aim on three different occasions.</p>

<p>Despite the good offices of imperial
match-makers, who would have married him
to some great princess of a reigning house in
Europe, Alfonso persisted in wedding his
own choice. He married his cousin, Marie
de las Mercedes, daughter of the Duke of
Montpensier&mdash;a love-match which death disrupted
less than six months later.</p>

<p>Kings may marry, but kings may not
mourn; so within another six months he was
united to the Archduchess Maria Christina,
niece of the Emperor of Austria, who, the
story goes, when she had heard of Alfonso’s
first marriage, was so disappointed that she
entered a convent. A child was born and
named Mercedes, after the former queen;
then yet another daughter; but no male heir
to the throne before the death of the king,
which occurred on the 25th of November,
1885. Whether his death was caused by excesses,
as has been sometimes charged, or
by his chivalrous insistence upon visiting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
afflicted cholera districts of his kingdom,
mattered little to the people, who mourned
sincerely for their brave young king, cut off
in the flower of his manhood, with his great
schemes unaccomplished.</p>

<p>For the first time since the death of Ferdinand
VII, more than fifty years before, the
vaults in the Escorial were opened for the
reception of another occupant. In accordance
with an ancient custom, when the funeral
cortège arrived at the door of the Escorial,
the keeper within demanded, “Who
would enter here?” One of the attendants
answered, “Alfonso XII would enter,” and
the door was thrown open. Even then Alfonso
was not considered as officially defunct,
until the lord chamberlain, drawing back
the cloth of gold covering his features, addressed
him: “Señor, señor, señor,” and, receiving
no reply, said solemnly: “His Majesty
does not answer; then indeed the king
is dead!”</p>

<p>The king was dead; to his place succeeded
his elder daughter, little Mercedes,
Princess of the Asturias, during whose minority
the queen-mother reigned as regent.
For the seventh time in five hundred years a
minor sat on the throne of Spain. The first
of whom we have record was Ferdinand IV,
at the beginning of the fourteenth century;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
he died young, and was succeeded by an infant
son, Alfonso VI; at the end of that century
there was another child-king, Henry III,
from 1390 to 1406; and after him John VI,
who reigned from 1406 to 1454; Charles II,
who came to be king at the age of fourteen,
in 1676; and Isabella, the age of three, in
1833. Child kings and queens, babes in arms
enthroned in nurses’ laps, and unscrupulous
regents during their minorities, seem to have
been a Spanish evil!</p>

<p>But the child queen Mercedes was not to
reign long, for six months after the death of
Alfonso XII the queen gave birth to a son,
and this posthumous heir succeeded to the
throne as Alfonso XIII, while yet unable to
understand the fearful dignities that were
thrust upon him. He was thus the eighth
infant sovereign to rule Spain from the nursery
within the past five centuries&mdash;perhaps
may be the last; for as people grow older
they are supposed to grow wiser; though all
rules may have their exceptions, and perhaps
the Spaniards are exceptions to all rules!</p>

<p>Still, we can not withhold our admiration
from a chivalrous sentiment, however foolish
it may seem to sober sense; and when it was
suggested to Emilio Castelar, the lion-hearted
orator and statesman, that this might be a
good time for a re-trial of the republic, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
probably voiced the national feeling when he
said: “We can not make war against a woman
and a child!” That is the unthinking,
sentimental side of it; but if the people had
been brave enough to have said: “While we
do not wish to war against a woman and her
child, yet we will set this infant aside until
he has shown what manner of man he becomes,”
would it not have been far less cruel
to her and to him, and more to the credit of
a nation desirous of keeping pace with a
progressive civilization?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">SPAIN AND HER COLONIES.</p>

<p class="p2">Although the present King of Spain,
Alfonso XIII, is the great-great-grandson of
Charles IV, Don Carlos V, the “pretender,”
is also a great-grandson of that monarch, and
has probably a more strictly legitimate claim
to the throne than its occupant. Yet again,
the mother of Alfonso XIII, the Queen-Regent
Christina, although frequently alluded
to by some of her subjects as “that Hapsburg
woman,” can claim an unbroken line of descent
from Isabella and Ferdinand, through
Ferdinand I, second son of “Juana Loca” and
Philip of Burgundy. Thus the ancestry of his
maternal parent may be said to legitimize this
titular King of Spain, while his posthumous
birth “has excited a feeling of pitying loyalty
which may help to secure the Bourbon dynasty
in the last kingdom which is left to it.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>
<p>Spain, under the regency, has been governed
by a constitutional monarchy, which
was proclaimed in 1876. By its Constitution,
the king is inviolable; he is the executive, and
the power to make laws is vested in him and
the Cortes, which comprises a senate and a
congress, coequal in authority. The senators
are of three classes: First, those by their
own right, as grandees of the kingdom, privileged
through their titles and possessions; in
the second place, those nominated by the
Crown; in the third, those elected by the communal
and provincial states, the church, universities,
etc. Congress is composed of deputies,
at the rate of one to every fifty thousand
in the population; though since 1878
Cuba has been entitled to one in every forty
thousand of free inhabitants paying taxes
to the amount of twenty-five dollars annually.</p>

<p>The whole country is, or should be, represented
in the legislative power, and by the
Constitution mutual checks are placed upon
both king and Cortes; for while the former
issues his decrees, yet they must be countersigned
by one of his ministers, and he can not
marry without their approval. Further details
of government are divided amongst
the ministers&mdash;of war, marine, agriculture,
commerce, public works, justice, finance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
colonies, foreign affairs, and a president of
the council.</p>

<p>Thus, while the king might be morally responsible
for an unpopular law, yet he could
not be held accountable through his inviolability,
and the odium of it would fall upon
the ministers of his appointing, who might
placate popular resentment by resigning.
This explanation will account for the frequent
changes in the ministry, not only during
the reign of Alfonso XII, but under the
regency. After the death of Alfonso XII,
and after the queen regent had taken the
oath of allegiance to the Constitution, a ministry
was formed under the leadership of the
great Liberal, Señor Sagasta, to whom the
Conservative Canovas promised his support,
as well as the Republican Castelar. Beneath
the shadow of their great calamity, all parties
nobly rallied to the support of the queen with
a loyalty which was, if anything, intensified
by the birth of the infant Alfonso XIII, on
May 17, 1886. But in September of that year
a revolt broke out under General Villafranca,
in which ten thousand men were more or less
implicated, and which was suppressed only
after great exertions on the part of the loyal
troops. The premier, Sagasta, had pledged
himself to reforms of many kinds, but he
had the greatest difficulty in redeeming them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
without the support of the Government
officials, who were as corrupt as they were
numerous; for, since the times when Spain
owned vast colonial possessions, there had
always been a corrupt official class revelling
in the uncounted millions that overflowed
from the colonial treasury. Even so late as
1888 it was estimated that nearly three million
dollars were embezzled during that year
by civil employees, and thus the annual deficit
was vastly enhanced.</p>

<p>So, Liberal and Conservative ministries alternated
every little while, sometimes Canovas
being in power, and again Sagasta. The position
of prime minister to the regency was at
best a thankless task, and only the highest
patriotism could induce one to accept its
onerous duties. In 1893, for instance, Señor
Sagasta was stoned by a mob at San Sebastian;
and in 1896, on the 7th of June, that
upright and patriotic statesman, Señor A.
Canovas del Castillo, was assassinated by an
Italian anarchist; at the same time, other
anarchists were attempting to excite a revolution
by means of bombs and dynamite.
The trivial pretexts upon which a ministry
might be overthrown are illustrated in an
incident of the queen regent’s journey from
Madrid to Valencia on matters of state.
She intrusted her nominal powers to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Infanta Isabella, as also the military watchword;
but the latter concluded that she would
take a little journey, and she in turn informed
the military governor, General Campos,
that the “watchword” would be given
him at the proper time by her sister Eulalia.
Thereupon General Campos announced that,
inasmuch as Eulalia was married to the
Duc de Montpensier, who held only the military
rank of captain, he, a general, could
not, of course, receive the countersign from
a subordinate! The Minister of War being
appealed to, General Campos resigned, and
the affair was not concluded until after the
resignation of the entire ministry, and Premier
Sagasta had twice surrounded himself
with a new body of advisers. It would seem,
indeed, that etiquette, not patriotism, was
paramount at the court of Spain! Next to
etiquette, superstition perhaps holds rank;
for quite recently the bones of a thirteenth-century
saint were carried through the streets
of Madrid, followed by a procession of eight
hundred priests, in order that a threatened
drought might be averted and the war with
Cuba concluded.</p>

<p class="p2">At the beginning of the year 1898 Spain’s
colonial possessions in America comprised
Cuba and Puerto Rico, the former with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
area of about 45,000 square miles, and a
population then estimated at 1,600,000; the
latter, about 3,600 square miles in area, and with
813,000 inhabitants. In Asia, the Philippine
Islands, about 2,000 in number, 114,300 square
miles in area, and with a population of about
8,000,000; the Carolines and Palaos, 560
square miles in area, and 36,000 population;
the Sulu Islands, 950 square miles, and 75,000
inhabitants; and the Marianne or Ladrone
Islands, 420 square miles in area, and with
10,000 population&mdash;a total of 164,830 square
miles, and 10,521,000 people. In Africa and
off its west coast, several small colonies, aggregating
3,650 miles in area, and 461,000
population. A grand total in America, Asia,
and Africa of about 168,480 square miles, and
10,982,000 population. Thus, notwithstanding
her enormous losses in the past, Spain
still held foreign possessions, at the opening
of 1898, with an aggregate area nearly seven-eighths
that of the mother country, and a
population more than half as large.</p>

<p>Three centuries and more ago Spain
swayed the world, the possessions pertaining
to her great empire being vaster than those
to-day controlled by Great Britain. Her
losses began near the close of the sixteenth
century, under Philip II, when her North
African provinces slipped away; under Philip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
III she lost Naples, Sicily, and Burgundy;
early in the seventeenth century she lost the
Netherlands; a little later, the rich Spice
Islands of the East; in 1640, Portugal; in
1659, the Pyrenean provinces of France; in
1704 Gibraltar fell into British hands, and
has been retained by Britain ever since; in
1800 Louisiana was ceded to France, and
that vast territory was forever lost when it
was sold by Bonaparte to the United States
in 1803. The first quarter of the nineteenth
century saw the severance from Spain of all
her South American colonies, Central America,
Mexico, and the Floridas; the year before
its close she lost her last remaining islands in
the West Indies&mdash;Cuba and Puerto Rico; and
in Asia, the Philippines and the Sulus.</p>

<p>Rapidly reviewing the barbarous colonial
policy of Spain&mdash;a policy which has been consistently
cruel and rapacious ever since it was
inaugurated in the time of Ferdinand and
Isabella&mdash;the only wonder is that she so long
retained such vast and distant possessions,
separated from the governing country by
broad oceans, and containing peoples so
numerous and dissimilar. The first large
island discovered by Columbus, which still
retains its native name of Cuba, was inhabited
by Indians of gentle nature, courteous
and kind. They were numerous also, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
cultivated the most fertile portions of the
island. For nearly twenty years after the
discovery Cuba was left in peace; but when
the settlements were founded, the barbarities
of Haiti and the Bahamas were re-enacted,
the Indians were enslaved, and reduced to
such a condition of misery that hundreds
killed themselves in despair. It was not
many years, in truth, before they had entirely
disappeared, having been murdered, directly
and indirectly, by the despicable Spaniards.</p>

<p>To fill their places, the Spaniards imported
negro slaves from Africa, who were
treated, like the Indians, with excessive
cruelty, but who were more tenacious of life
than the unfortunate aborigines, and their
descendants constitute a large proportion
of the Cuban population at the present time.
One of the largest and wealthiest of Spain’s
islands beyond the sea, Cuba early became
a prey to Spanish adventurers and English
freebooters. For more than three hundred
years, except for a short period in 1762,
Cuba has been in the clutches of Spain, her
lands cultivated until within a few years by
slave labour, her revenues plundered by rapacious
officials. Gradually there has grown
up a native population, distinct from the
“peninsular” Spanish&mdash;a population speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the same language as the immigrants
from the home country, yet differing from
them, inasmuch as about half the islanders
have mulatto or negro blood in their veins,
and are looked upon and treated by the
“peninsulars” as inferiors.</p>

<p>During more than three hundred and fifty
years the natives patiently submitted to oppression
and extortion in every form; but
the political disquietude in Spain was soon
reflected in her colonies, and long after the
loss of Mexico, Central and South America
to the motherland, Cuba attempted to break
the chains that bound her to Spain. There
was an uprising of the blacks in 1844, and in
1851 a filibustering raid under General Lopez,
a Venezuelan, who was killed in his third invasion
of the island, as well as several filibusters
from the United States. An offer to
purchase the island, shortly after, made to
Spain by the President of the United States,
met with no favour, as Spanish pride and interests
were against it.</p>

<p>The most serious revolt against the Spaniards
occurred in 1868, consequent upon the
distracted condition of Spain during the revolutionary
proceedings which exiled Isabella II.
The leader of this revolt, Carlos de Cespedes,
was subsequently elected president of a republic
which the insurgents finally set up, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
for ten years, during which at least seventy-five
thousand Spanish soldiers perished in the
island, and the natives suffered every conceivable
indignity from the “peninsulars,”
the war was waged, only to be concluded by
a deceitful promise of reforms which were
never granted. General Martinez Campos,
then the Captain-General of Cuba, and authorized
representative of Spain, signed
the “capitulation” of El Zanjon in 1878, by
which the insurgents were induced to surrender,
under a pledge that their demands
should be acceded to; but Señor Canovas,
then Prime Minister of Spain, refused to recognise
this treaty, and so all their terrible
sacrifices came to naught. It was but natural
that the patriots should feel resentful;
but they remained quiescent for seventeen
years, at the end of which period, in February,
1895, the long-smouldering embers of
revolt again burst into flame.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">CUBA’S FIGHT FOR FREEDOM.</p>

<p class="p2">While it may be difficult to write a dispassionate
account of a war in which the
sympathies of the writer have been ardently
enlisted on one side as against the other, and
to paint a picture which lacks the perspective
afforded by the lapse of time, yet an
attempt will be made to present such an account
and such a picture as will stand the
test of unprejudiced criticism.</p>

<p>The object of the insurgents during the
ten years’ war was to secure reforms in the
national administration, actual representation
in the Cortes, and amelioration of their intolerable
condition. They secured nothing, for
though eventually granted the privilege of
representation, in 1878, this privilege was nullified
by the representatives being mainly selected
from the ranks of the peninsulars themselves!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
And now, in 1895, having in mind
the duplicity by which they had been tricked,
the Cuban patriots aimed at nothing less than
<i>independence</i>! This idea of actual and complete
severance from Spain they have consistently
persisted in from the very first; and
when the end came, finding them impoverished
and starving, their ranks decimated by war and
disease, they still clung to the rock of independence,
upon which they purposed to found
their long-cherished republic.</p>

<p>Dominated by this grand idea, animated
by a resolve that nothing could shake, the
leaders of the revolt of 1895 were mainly
those who had survived the war of 1868-’78,
such as the brothers Maceo, Gomez, and
Garcia. The veteran Gomez was their recognised
chief, and under him they withstood
the assaults of Spanish arms for more than
three years, the number of Spanish soldiers
at the termination of the struggle amounting
to more than one hundred thousand. Spain
sent to Cuba her best commanders and the
flower of her soldiery, many thousands of
whom, fighting the cause of despotism against
that of freedom, fell victims to Spanish barbarities.
The redoubtable General Campos,
the “pacificator” of the former war, was
sent out with ample means and placed in
supreme control; but, though with one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
thousand troops at his command, after
the cost of the war had mounted to more than
sixty million dollars, he was recalled, and the
notorious General Weyler sent in his place.</p>

<p>Whatever may be charged against General
Campos, he was at least humane, as
compared with his successor. It was through
no fault of his, but owing to the perfidy of
the home Government, that the treaty of
Zanjon had not been respected; and it was
even charged against him in Spain that he
rather favoured than earnestly combated the
insurgents. At all events, no such charge
could be brought against the inhuman Weyler,
who at once began a war of extermination,
laid waste the country, and committed
such atrocities that his name will ever be
held in detestation by succeeding generations.
Unable to overcome the insurgents
in honourable warfare, Captain-General Weyler
inaugurated a system of butcheries that
caused a shudder to run through all civilized
communities when informed of his wanton
waste of human life. Although he had behind
him the vast resources of Spain, held
command of an army four times as large as
the combined forces of the insurgents, and
could have summoned to his aid a magnificent
array of naval vessels, yet he could not
cope with those half-starved, ragged, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
nearly naked patriots, fighting for their lives
and for their liberties.</p>

<p>When captured&mdash;which was not often&mdash;the
insurgents were treated as bandits, and
suffered ignominious deaths; and it is no
palliation of Spanish crimes to say that the
insurgents themselves adopted the barbarous
methods of their enemy. Little can be said
in excuse of the atrocities committed on either
side, for the system of warfare they were pursuing
was not honourable. Yet, despite the
knowledge that they were courting certain
death by their insistence, the insurgents put
forth every effort to drive the Spaniards
within the towns and cities, and were in the
main successful.</p>

<p>General Weyler divided the whole island
into departments, and across it, from northern
to southern coast, at intervals stretched
a system of rude fortifications called a <i>trocha</i>,
guarded by his soldiery. Through these
<i>trochas</i> the insurgents broke repeatedly, at
one time sweeping the island from the eastern
province of Santiago to the extreme
western province of Pinar del Rio. In the
spring of 1896 even Havana felt a tremor of
fear at the coming of the native hordes,
which encamped within striking distance of
the forts around the city. But though the
gallant Antonio Maceo raided around Havana<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and ravaged Pinar del Rio, he met
death finally through treachery, and the immediate
danger was averted. There was at
no time any real danger that the capital and
other strong cities like Matanzas, Cienfuegos,
and Santiago should be attacked and overcome,
since the insurgents had no artillery,
little ammunition, and insufficient forces to
reduce and capture the strongholds of the
Spaniards. But they made their camps in
inaccessible fastnesses, pursuing a guerrilla
mode of warfare, pouncing upon the enemy
suddenly without warning, and carrying off
his stores and ammunition trains, blowing up
the tracks and viaducts of railroads, setting
fire to unprotected plantations, and destroying
the growing crops of tobacco and sugar
cane. And what the insurgents failed to
destroy, General Weyler seized, having determined
upon a policy of destruction and extermination
that would eventually reduce
this fair island, so long known as the “Pearl
of the Antilles,” from a most fertile country
to an uninhabited desert. To this end he
issued his edicts of “reconcentration,” by
which all inhabitants of the country districts
were ordered to concentrate in and around
the cities, and their farms and gardens were
destroyed. This was for the purpose of depriving
the insurgents, who ranged the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
parts and subsisted upon the natives who
sympathized with them, of all food and supplies
whatsoever. An inhuman policy, but
not original with Weyler, for Spaniards had
pursued it before, though in times when the
amenities of civilization were not recognised
as they are to-day; and the whole military
world repudiated it and reprobated its authors.</p>

<p>No tongue, no pen, can adequately describe
the sufferings, the callous cruelties,
that ensued when the <i>reconcentrados</i>&mdash;as these
unhappy victims of Weyler’s edicts were
teamed&mdash;were finally gathered in the cities,
where they could be watched by the tyrant’s
soldiers. For, though they were assembled
by his orders, against their inclinations, having
abandoned homes and farms, every means
of subsistence, they were left to starve and
die with scarcely any effort being made for
their relief. First scores, then hundreds, then
thousands, starved in the streets, fell and
died like dogs; fathers of families were compelled
to witness the agonizing sufferings of
their children, without the possibility of affording
them relief; mothers lost their little
ones by slow starvation, while themselves enduring
the torments of diseases induced by
their condition. One by one, family after
family, finally the inhabitants of whole villages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and hamlets, perished miserably, and it
at last seemed evident to Weyler that his
policy would prevail and the insurgents succumb
to starvation, if not to powder and
bullets.</p>

<p>But meanwhile&mdash;though the author of all
these torments gloated over the miseries he
had created, though he grew immensely rich
from the plunder of his victims&mdash;his soldiers
could not prevail against the intrepid insurgents.
They hid in caves and swamps,
they grew gaunt and weak from starvation,
but they still persisted in their determination
to resist to the death.</p>

<p>So far as possible, through suppression of
news, through accounts of victories never
achieved, successes never gained, and reports
of insurgent atrocities never perpetrated,
the Spaniards had misinformed the
world at large regarding conditions in Cuba.
The Spanish queen, who was concerned with
a mother’s solicitude for the throne upon
which her boy-king sat; the Spanish people,
inured to cruelty through traditions from the
past and the bullfights of modern times: the
people of the “motherland” of Cuba, gazed
complacently upon these unparalleled sufferings
of a rebellious population; but the rest
of the world finally protested.</p>

<p>“This is not war; this is butchery; these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
atrocities must cease!” was the universal protest.
Still, the cause of humanity, while broad
as the world and of universal acceptation,
at first found no champion. The weeks and
months went by, and the <i>reconcentrados</i> died
like wild beasts, neglected, spurned, by their
captors, apparently forgotten by all fellow-creatures.
And yet hands were stretched
out to them, hearts were bleeding for them
(though vainly, perforce), in a country adjacent
to their island, from which it is separated
only by a channel less than one hundred
miles in width. One hundred miles
away, only a few hours’ sail, lay the borders
of a nation pledged to the maintenance of
human rights and the righting of human
wrongs. Why, then, could it not step in and
stay the progress of that car of Juggernaut
before it was too late?</p>

<p>Why, indeed? Why did not England,
Russia, or Germany stay the hand of the
Turk when he was cutting the throats of
helpless Armenians? of the Moslem, when
he was murdering the Christian people of
Crete?</p>

<p>Because international diplomacy has recognised
the right of a country or nation to
deal with its recalcitrant subjects as it may
deem best. When nations go to war it is
seldom for the righting of real wrongs, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
on some trivial pretext like that which precipitated
the conflict between France and
Germany in 1870&mdash;a country’s “injured honour,”
but rarely its injured people!</p>

<p>The time arrived, however, when Cuba’s
neighbors in the United States could no
longer turn a deaf ear to the appeals of suffering
humanity so near to their shores. It
is true that the people of the United States
had been outspoken in their sympathy long
before; that a Cuban junta had found a
refuge in New York, whence it sent relief
and planned expeditions for the benefit of
the insurgents. In accordance with international
usage, the Government of the United
States used every effort to frustrate the plans
of the junta and to maintain an attitude of
neutrality, since the insurgents had not been
accorded belligerency&mdash;that is, their cause
was not recognised by nations&mdash;and in the
eyes of the nation with which they were at
war they were only rebels against lawful authority.
It was a delicate situation for the
Americans: their sympathies enlisted in behalf
of the Cuban rebels, yet constrained by
their regard for the laws from giving them
governmental assistance!</p>

<p>For several years, and during at least two
administrations, the majority of the newspapers
of the country had urged Congress to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
accord the Cubans belligerent rights, by which
their status as fighters would be defined and
their acts in a sense legitimized. At last
the clamour became so great that Congress
could no longer ignore what was the very
evident wish of the people of the United
States; yet it is doubtful if decisive action
would have been immediately taken had not
an incident occurred which shook the nation
to its very centre.</p>

<p>The condition of things in Havana became
so alarming that the consul-general of
the United States requested the presence of
a war vessel for the protection of Americans
there, and the battleship Maine, one of the
finest in the navy, was sent on a friendly visit
to that port. It has since been shown that
her presence was unnecessary at that time;
but, at all events, the Americans were well
within their rights in sending her there, and
she was received with the usual honours.
Shortly after her arrival, however, on February
15, 1898, while lying peacefully at the
buoy to which she was shown by the Spanish
captain of the port, she was blown up and
sunk, with two hundred and sixty of her
officers and crew.</p>

<p>Through the country shot a thrill of horror
at this dastardly act, succeeded by instant
and universal demands for vengeance. Calm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
counsels prevailed, however. A board of inquiry
was convened by order of the President,
and after weeks of calm investigation, during
which the American public awaited the result
with splendid forbearance, yet with ever-increasing
determination to punish the actual
perpetrators of this fiendish deed, it was officially
announced that the explosion which
had wrecked the Maine and sent so many of
her brave men into eternity was <i>from without</i>,
and presumably from a submarine mine!</p>

<p>Now, submarine mines of the size and
power sufficient to sink a great battleship
can not be placed in position by mere individual
effort; and the instant inference was
that the Spanish Government, which had
caused the harbour of Havana to be furtively
mined, was, if not the actual criminal,
the cause of the crime! Still, even when
this conviction was forced home upon those
most unwilling to believe in the criminality
of Spain, President McKinley refused to commit
himself to hasty action. It was not until
the 20th of April, when, as he himself confessed,
he had “exhausted every effort to relieve
the intolerable condition of affairs at
our doors,” that he availed himself of the
authority conferred upon him by Congress to
intervene in Cuba, using the military and naval
forces of the United States, and sent an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
ultimatum to Spain. He had wisely treated
the Maine explosion, aggravating as it was,
as an incident merely; but as affording conclusive
proof “of an intolerable state of
things in Cuba, sufficiently acute to warrant
the intervention of the United States.”</p>

<p>On the very day of the ultimatum to Spain,
the Spanish minister at Washington demanded
his passports, and on the next day the American
minister left Madrid. War was virtually
declared on the 21st of April, 1898.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES.</p>

<p class="p2">President McKinley had opposed the
inclination of the people for immediate hostilities,
and did not sanction an appeal to the
arbitrament of battle until he had exhausted
every device of diplomacy; yet, when once
committed to war, he was most energetic in
his efforts to prepare the country for its task.
Himself a soldier, having served gallantly
through the civil war between the States, he
knew the value of immediate action. On the
22d of April he issued a proclamation declaring
the principal ports of Cuba in a state of
blockade, and on the 23d, a call for one hundred
and twenty-five thousand volunteers to
serve for two years or the war. A further
call was later issued, raising the number of
volunteers to two hundred thousand, and this
appeal was eagerly responded to by the patriotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
people. They showed the sincerity of
their convictions by their acts, and the quotas
of the various States were rapidly filled;
camps of instruction were established in the
East and South; arsenals, foundries, shipyards,
and all branches of military and naval
construction, were soon the scenes of unsurpassed
activity.</p>

<p>In a message to Congress, in 1898, President
McKinley had said: “The long trial has
proved that the object for which Spain has
waged the war can not be attained. The fire
of insurrection may flame or may smoulder
with varying seasons, but it has not been,
and it is plain that it can not be, extinguished
by present methods. The only hope of relief
and repose from a condition which can no
longer be endured is the enforced pacification
of Cuba. In the name of humanity, in the
name of civilization, in behalf of endangered
American interests which give us the right
and the duty to speak and to act, the war in
Cuba must stop.”</p>

<p>“In view of all this, the Congress was
asked to authorize and empower the President
to take measures to secure a final termination
of hostilities between Spain and the
people of Cuba, and to secure in the island
the establishment of a stable government,
capable of maintaining order, observing its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
international obligations, insuring peace and
tranquility, the security of its citizens as
well as our own, and for the accomplishment
of those ends to use the military and naval
forces of the United States as might be
necessary; with added authority to continue
generous relief to the starving people of
Cuba.”</p>

<p>The response of the Congress, after nine
days of earnest deliberation, was to pass the
memorable joint resolution declaring:</p>

<p>“First, That the people of the island of
Cuba are, and of right ought to be, free and
independent.</p>

<p>“Second, That it is the duty of the United
States to demand, and the Government of the
United States does hereby demand, that the
Government of Spain at once relinquish its
authority and government in the island of
Cuba and withdraw its land and naval forces
from Cuba and Cuban waters.</p>

<p>“Third, That the President of the United
States be, and he hereby is, directed and empowered
to use the entire land and naval
forces of the United States, and to call into
the actual service of the United States the
militia of the several States, to such extent as
may be necessary to carry these resolutions
into effect.</p>

<p>“Fourth, That the United States hereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
disclaims any disposition or intention to exercise
sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over
said island except for the pacification thereof,
and asserts its determination when that is
accomplished to leave the government and
control of the island to its people.”</p>

<p>This resolution was approved by the Executive
on the next day, April 20th. A copy
was at once communicated to the Spanish minister
at the capital, who forthwith announced
that his continuance in Washington had thereby
become impossible, and asked for his passports,
which were given him. He thereupon
withdrew from Washington, leaving the protection
of Spanish interests in the United
States to the French ambassador and the
Austro-Hungarian minister.</p>

<p>Congress had voted the President, in anticipation
of war and the necessity for preparation,
the sum of fifty million dollars, to be
used at his discretion; and this money was
soon spent for powder, guns, forts, and mines,
for coast defence, auxiliary ships for the
navy, cannon, army and naval stores, medicines
in vast quantities, and clothing for the
new recruits.</p>

<p>“Under the direction of the Chief of Engineers,
submarine mines were placed at the
most exposed points. Before the outbreak
of war permanent mining casemates and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
cable galleries had been constructed at
nearly all important harbours. Most of the
torpedo material was not to be found in the
market, and had to be specially manufactured.
Under date of April 19th, district officers
were directed to take all preliminary
measures, short of the actual attaching of the
loaded mines to the cables, and on April 22d
telegraphic orders were issued to place the
loaded mines in position. The aggregate
number of mines placed was 1,535, at the
principal harbours from Maine to California.”</p>

<p>The standing army of the United States
in time of peace did not exceed twenty-five
thousand men, but the State militia afforded
drafts of soldiers who were soon converted
into good fighting material in the various
camps of instruction.</p>

<p>One beneficent effect of this appeal to
arms in support of a cause which enlisted the
highest sympathies, was the obliteration of
all sectional lines that had existed on account
of the civil war between the States.
Many Confederate veterans, who had fought
against the Union, now hastened to offer their
services in its defence. A wave of patriotism
swept the country from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, and from the Great Lakes to the Florida
Channel. The solidarity of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
was made apparent when such brave officers
of the civil war as Generals Lee and Wheeler,
who had fought on the “losing side,” sought
and obtained positions of a rank commensurate
with their great abilities. It was conclusively
shown that the Americans had not,
as often charged by their enemies, become
weak and effeminate in sordid pursuits, and
lost to all sense of honour and moral obligations.</p>

<p>The nation, then, responded nobly to the
President’s call for soldiers and supplies, and
within a week its naval vessels were blockading
the ports of Cuba, and its armies moving
southward to a base whence they could
promptly invade the enemy’s territory. On
the 27th of April the Spanish batteries of
Matanzas, Cuba, were shelled by Admiral
Sampson’s flagship, the New York, and other
war vessels, though without any material advantage.
On the 29th of April a Spanish
fleet, commanded by Admiral Cervera, and
consisting of four armoured cruisers and
three torpedo boats and “destroyers,” left
port in the Cape de Verde Islands and sailed
for West Indian waters.</p>

<p>At the outset it was believed that the
Spanish navy was vastly superior to that of
the United States, for there were several
battle ships of vast tonnage and heaviest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
armament, and cruisers of greater speed than
any possessed by the Americans. So, when
it was at first rumoured, then asserted as a
certainty, that a formidable Spanish fleet was
headed toward American shores, all was anxiety
along the Atlantic coast. Nothing is
more certain than that the Spaniards, had
they but possessed the necessary dash and
vigour, might have ravaged a portion of the
coast and destroyed several cities before
their enemies’ scattered fleets could have
concentrated to destroy them. But while at
the outset Spain had cruisers and battle
ships, torpedo boats and “destroyers,” in
numbers exceeding their opponents, yet there
was one factor she had overlooked&mdash;the men
who manned the ships and trained the guns!
While the American navy was at first inferior,
in guns and ships, to that of Spain, yet the
men had been trained to a higher state of
efficiency, than the Spanish sailors, as will be
shown a little later on.</p>

<p>But while a state of terrible suspense
prevailed regarding the whereabouts of Admiral
Cervera’s Spanish fleet, then presumably
on its way to destroy the coast cities of
the United States, there transpired something
in the far-away isles of the Pacific that at
once dissipated the gloom and restored confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>When, at the outbreak of the war, Great
Britain declared all her ports neutral&mdash;that is,
not open to war vessels of either combatant&mdash;the
United States Asiatic squadron, consisting
of four protected cruisers, two gunboats,
and a despatch boat, was lying in the
British port of Hong Kong. Driven out of
this port by the proclamation of neutrality,
Commodore George Dewey, in command of
the squadron, acting under orders from
Washington, steamed direct for the Philippine
Islands, valuable possessions of Spain,
discovered by Magellan in 1521, and settled
by Spaniards in 1565. He may have
had orders to go to the Philippines in any
event; but now that he was deprived of a
port, Commodore Dewey felt constrained to
take possession of another; so at daylight on
the morning of the 1st of May, 1898, his little
fleet was discovered by Spaniards on the
watch groping its way, over sunken mines
and between defensive batteries, into the
bay of Manila! The rich city of Manila, and
perhaps the entire Philippine chain, consisting
of about two thousand islands, was to be
the ultimate prize; but the immediate objective
was the Spanish fleet assembled for the
protection of the capital. This fleet, consisting
of seven cruisers and several gunboats,
was at last discovered by Commodore Dewey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
drawn up in battle array in the harbour of
Cavité, an inlet of Manila Bay, and at once
attacked.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Then ensued a scene of carnage, and ultimately
a victory, which was, perhaps, all
things considered, without a parallel in history.
For, though the opposing vessels were
very well matched, and their crews were about
the same in number, in a few hours every
Spanish ship was either blown up or sunk,
and the land batteries of Cavité were completely
silenced! The Spanish loss was terrible,
amounting to three hundred and eighty-one
in killed and wounded; but on the
American side not one was killed, only nine
were wounded, and eventually every man
returned to duty!</p>

<p>Such a decisive victory for the Americans,
and such a crushing defeat for Spain, had its
effect upon the respective countries, raising
the spirits of the “Yankees,” and correspondingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>depressing those of the Spaniards. The
city of Manila, which was dependent upon
the fleet for its protection, was now absolutely
at the mercy of the American commodore;
but he, as merciful as he was brave
and invincible, refrained from bombarding
it, preferring to await the arrival of troops
for its capture. As soon as possible troops
were despatched to the Philippines; but it
was the last week in May before the first
were aboard the transports, and about a
month more before they arrived at Manila.
Eventually some twenty thousand American
troops were concentrated at Manila, and then
the city was assaulted and captured, on August
13th, by the combined action of the
army and navy.</p>

<p>It was a strange chance that threw the
Philippines into the hands of the United
States; for, in the first place, it is said that
when the New World was divided between
Portugal and Spain, by the celebrated “bull”
of Pope Alexander VI, in 1493 (according to
which all discoveries after that west of an
ideal meridian were to belong to Spain, and
those east to Portugal), the Philippines would
rightfully have fallen to the last-named country.
But by a mistake of Magellan, their
discoverer, they were placed twenty or thirty
degrees nearer to America than they really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
were, and the error was never rectified. So,
through an error of the great Magellan, and
the prowess of the gallant Dewey, the United
States were put in possession of one of
Spain’s most valuable colonies.</p>

<p>It is said that republics are ungrateful;
but if the American Republic has been open
to that accusation in the past, it nobly redeemed
itself during the campaign against
the Spaniards. Commodore Dewey was at
once advanced to the rank of rear admiral,
and the thanks of the nation were conveyed
by its President to the brave sailors under
him, with the promise of substantial emoluments
later on. The moral effect of this
victory was vastly greater than the mere
material acquisitions; for it corrected a long-existent
misapprehension in Europe as to our
abilities, and advanced us at once an immeasurable
distance in its estimation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the United States every effort
was still put forth to equip the armies,
to perfect the fleets, and to bring the conflict
to an early and honourable close. Without
animosity toward their foes, with the
highest motives and incentives, the Americans
yet relaxed no endeavour in the vigorous
prosecution of the war.</p>

<p>The first American victims fell on May
11th, in an engagement with the batteries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Cardenas, Cuba, when, Ensign Bagley and
four sailors on the gunboat Winslow were
killed by Spanish shells; and the next day,
in the bombardment of San Juan, Puerto
Rico, one sailor was killed. This bombardment
was merely an incident in the search of
our fleets for Admiral Cervera’s squadron,
the whereabouts of which remained a mystery
for three long weeks. During this time
a “flying squadron” was organized and held
at Newport News, under command of Commodore
Schley, ready to steam to the succour
of whatever point should be menaced by the
Spanish ships, either North or South. At last
it became known that the Spaniards had been
seen in the West Indies, and the flying squadron
sailed for those waters. Admiral Sampson
meanwhile was cruising in the Caribbean
Sea, seeking an engagement with the Spanish
fleet; and as it was thought that the
enemy might seek shelter at San Juan, a port
on the north side of the island of Puerto
Rico, it was visited; but with no result other
than the bombardment of the fortifications
by the American fleet, though without inflicting
any material injury.</p>

<p>Word came at last that Admiral Cervera
had, in a roundabout way, safely reached the
landlocked harbour of Santiago de Cuba on
May 19th, and there he was “bottled up,” a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
few days later, by the flying squadron, which
was soon re-enforced by the fleet under Admiral
Sampson, who took command. Even
then, there was much doubt as to the actual
location of the Spanish squadron, until Lieutenant
Victor Blue by a daring reconnoissance
penetrated the enemy’s lines, at the risk of
being captured and shot as a spy, and ascertained
beyond peradventure that the fleet
was in the harbour of Santiago.</p>

<p>While the United States Government had
been concentrating troops at Tampa, and its
fleets at Key West and off the port of Havana,
yet it was apparently uncertain at which
point to invade Cuban soil, until the arrival
of the Spanish fleet at Santiago suddenly determined
the future theatre of war. As the
destruction of Admiral Cervera’s powerful
squadron was of more importance than anything
else, all the energies of the Government
were now put forth to accomplish it.
The fleet under command of Admiral Sampson
included the largest and most heavily
armoured cruisers and battle ships, besides
smaller craft, as gunboats and torpedo destroyers.
Added to these, the splendid battle
ship Oregon, which had been ordered from
San Francisco to the theatre of war, arrived
during the blockade of Santiago after a memorable
“run” around South America and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
through the Caribbean Sea. Thus the American
admiral had a fleet vastly superior to
that within the harbour; but the problem
was, how to get at it! Securely intrenched
behind the frowning hills around the harbour
entrance, which latter was filled with torpedoes
and submarine mines, the Spanish squadron
was for the time safe from harm.</p>

<p>A constant watch was kept on the narrow
entrance to Santiago’s harbour, on one side
guarded by the ancient Morro Castle, and on
the other by more modern batteries, upon
which at night were trained powerful electric
search-lights; and not a moment passed during
any twenty-four hours in which the captive
squadron could have escaped unobserved
from the trap in which it was caught.</p>

<p>The actual invasion of Cuba was begun
on the 10th of June at the bay of Guantanamo,
to the eastward of Santiago, by a force
of six hundred marines, when several men
were killed before a secure camp could be
obtained. Among the great results of this
occupation was the capture of the submarine
cable station, by means of which fleet and
army were soon put in communication with
Washington.</p>

<p>On the 3d of June a deed of heroism was
performed in the sinking of the collier Merrimac
across the narrow channel of Santiago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
harbour by Lieutenant Hobson and a crew
of seven men. This was done under a heavy
fire from the Spanish batteries, and while exposed
to the torpedoes set off by the enemy
when they discovered this attempt to obstruct
the channel. Lieutenant Hobson and
his men escaped death almost by a miracle,
only to fall into the hands of the enemy,
by whom they were taken to the Morro and
imprisoned. The attempt to block the channel
and thus absolutely prevent the escape
of the squadron within, was unavailing; but
this does not render the deed the less heroic.
And to show of what material the American
navy is composed&mdash;a navy that has been derided
by Europe and made the object of ridicule
by some citizen politicians&mdash;it was reported
that hundreds volunteered for this
desperate enterprise, even though well aware
that it meant to those who took part in it
almost certain death!</p>

<p>In response to the request of Admiral
Sampson, who represented that he would not
risk forcing the harbour entrance, filled as it
was with mines, an expedition of sixteen
thousand men was soon afloat on transports
in Tampa harbour, Florida, and after long
delays, reached the coast of Cuba, off Santiago,
on the 22d of June. These troops,
comprising the Fifth Army Corps, commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
by General Shafter, were soon landed at Baiquiri
and Siboney, despite the tremendous
surf, and lost no time in possessing themselves
of the country adjacent.</p>

<p>As time was precious, the troops of General
Shafter’s command were landed rapidly,
each man with three days’ rations and two
hundred rounds of ammunition, and the van
was pushing for Santiago while the rear was
disembarking. They encountered little opposition
at first, and the second day, or on
the 23d of June, a base of operations was secured
by the capture of Juragua. On the
24th the first blood was spilled, when the
dismounted cavalry, known as the Rough
Riders, were attacked, several miles beyond
the most advanced position, at La Guasimas,
and lost sixteen in killed and fifty-two
wounded. This attack by the Spaniards
upon troops struggling through a tropical
thicket was referred to by the men themselves
as merely a skirmish, and did not for
a moment cause them to falter.</p>

<p>The Spaniards withdrew from their advanced
positions, and a few days after the
skirmish at La Guasimas eight thousand
troops, under Generals Wheeler and Lawton,
occupied the hamlet of Sevilla without opposition.
The first great battle was a week
later, on the 1st of July, when a general advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
was ordered upon the outworks of
Santiago. Two important positions were
taken and held, that of El Caney by General
Lawton, consisting of a strong blockhouse
defended by rifle pits, and San Juan Hill by
General Kent. Both positions were gallantly
and obstinately defended by the Spaniards,
and it was only after repeated charges
by our troops that they were taken. The
charge up the steep slopes of San Juan Hill,
led by Colonel Roosevelt, compelled the unstinted
admiration of the foreign <i>attachés</i>
representing various European governments,
who could not sufficiently praise the gallant
“initiative,” as they called it, of the American
soldier. After two days’ hard fighting
the men intrenched and lay down on their
arms, with a loss of two hundred and thirty
killed and more than twelve hundred wounded.
Volunteers and regulars vied with each
other in deeds of bravery, in individual
heroism, and it would be impossible to mention
every hero of this fight. The Spaniards
fought well also, and as they possessed weapons
superior to those of the Americans, and
cartridges loaded with smokeless powder, and
were in the main sheltered behind intrenchments,
they had a great advantage.</p>

<p>Within the fortifications of Santiago were
about fifteen thousand soldiers under General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Linares; without, as many Americans
under General Shafter, who by two days of
fighting had gained positions whence they
could command the city. Re-enforcements
were constantly arriving, and soon the heavy
siege guns would be brought to the front and
the Spaniards driven from the forts and intrenchments.
At first a general assault was
contemplated by the Americans, but this idea
was abandoned when it was found that the
enemy was so strongly intrenched, so desperate,
and equipped with superior arms.</p>

<p>While the American general was undecided
what to do, a new diversion was caused, on the
morning of July 3d, by the fleet of Admiral
Cervera making a sudden dash for liberty.
The admiral’s position had become, or soon
would become, untenable, and he was forced
to the desperate determination to fly out in
the face of the Yankee war ships and take the
one chance for liberty. About half past nine
in the morning the lookout on the battle ship
Texas gave the alarm: “The fleet is coming
out!” Signals were set, but the black smoke
from the funnels of the fleet betrayed their
design, and the battle ships Iowa and Oregon,
and the armoured cruiser Brooklyn, at once
hastened with all steam toward the harbour
entrance.</p>

<p>It was a magnificent spectacle: that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the gathering war ships speeding toward the
Spanish squadron, which, with the Infanta
Maria Teresa, Admiral Cervera’s flagship,
in the lead, followed by the Cristobal Colon,
the Vizcaya, the Almirante Oquendo, and the
two torpedo destroyers Furor and Pluton,
steamed slowly into view, and then, with increasing
speed, turned down the western coast.</p>

<p>What followed then was a test of speed
and endurance, for it had long been maintained
that the Spanish war ships were the
superiors of the American in these respects.
What then ensued quickly proved the contrary
to be true, for within one short hour
three of the great battle ships were driven
ashore and sunk, riddled with shells, and with
flames bursting from every port. The Texas,
Oregon, Iowa, and Brooklyn dashed upon
them like eagles swooping upon their prey,
pouring in terrible broadsides and sweeping
their decks with their rapid-fire guns. The
great thirteen-inch shells tore through the
belts of steel armour, smashed the boilers
and machinery, setting fire to the magazines,
and in a short time completely disabling the
pride and boast of the Spanish navy. The
two torpedo destroyers, which had been so
much exploited as terrors of the sea, were
disposed of in a few minutes by the Texas,
Iowa, and Gloucester, and sunk with a loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of two thirds of their crews. Meanwhile,
the Cristobal Colon, the only ship remaining,
was speeding along the coast, with the Oregon
and Brooklyn, followed by the New York,
Admiral Sampson’s flagship, in close pursuit.
But it was a vain attempt at escape; about
fifty miles from the harbour of Santiago the
Colon was driven ashore, shattered by shells
and on fire in many places. This was at one
o’clock, and thus it had taken less than five
hours for the glorious Yankee ships with
their gallant crews to destroy the Spanish
squadron and capture its officers and crews.
And this was effected with a loss to the victor
of but one man killed, while the losses of the
Spaniards amounted to more than six hundred
killed and thirteen hundred prisoners!</p>

<p>This disparity in casualties might be considered
miraculous were it not for the notorious
fact that Spanish gunners can not shoot,
and that on this particular occasion many of
them were intoxicated and fired wildly; while
the Yankee sailors, trained by long practice,
made all their shots “tell” with terrible effect.
It was then seen that, more than to
battle ships and belts of armour, more than
to speed and calibre of cannon, the American
nation was indebted for victory to the men
behind the guns! The Spaniards were brave
even to rashness; they may have fought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
equally well with the Americans, yet they did
not possess their skill, their tenacity of purpose,
their intelligence.</p>

<p>It was a glorious victory, yet tempered
with regret for the fallen foe. The national
sentiment of pity and sympathy was voiced
by Captain Philip, of the Texas, who, when
his crew sent up shouts of exultation at the
sight of the shattered Vizcaya’s men driven
from their guns by an explosion, cried out:
“Don’t cheer, boys; those poor fellows are
dying!” And every effort was put forth to
save the survivors, by those who so recently
had been intent upon their destruction.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">SPAIN AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR.</p>

<p class="p2">The loss of Cervera’s fleet nearly broke
the Spanish heart&mdash;at all events, its proud and
haughty spirit. For, while it was not expected
that Spain (which had not gained an
important naval victory since that of Lepanto
over the Turks, in 1571) would eventually
win, yet it was thought that some meed of
glory might accrue from its great armament
and expenditure for fighting machines. At
the end of the war&mdash;for this victory virtually
ended it&mdash;Spain’s naval losses amounted to
thirty-seven vessels of all classes, or about
one half of her entire navy, and forty per
cent of her total tonnage, valued at more
than twenty-seven million dollars. Her killed
in battle numbered at least two thousand,
the wounded many more; while the total
killed in the naval engagements on the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
side numbered only seventeen, with less
than one hundred wounded.</p>

<p>Two weeks after the fleet was destroyed
Santiago surrendered, and with it there fell to
the victors the entire eastern province of
Cuba, with twenty-two thousand prisoners
of war. By the terms of capitulation, all
soldiers and officers of the Spanish army in
and about Santiago were transported to Spain
at the expense of the United States Government.
The thirteen hundred prisoners from
Cervera’s fleet were at first taken to Portsmouth,
New Hampshire, where they were
well housed and kindly cared for; the officers
were confined at Annapolis, where their treatment
was such as to call forth the most lively
expressions of gratitude from the captured
admiral and his colleagues. As there were no
American prisoners for whom to exchange
these unfortunates, they were finally released
and sent home, about the middle of September,
1898.</p>

<p>Santiago surrendered on July 17th, and
eight days later General Nelson A. Miles,
with several thousand troops landed at a port
of Puerto Rico and captured the important
city of Ponce. His invasion was skilfully
planned and was being carried out with consummate
strategy, when, after nearly all the
southern and western settlements had fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
into his hands, operations were stopped by
orders from Washington. On the day following
the landing of American troops in Puerto
Rico the United States Government had been
approached by the ambassador of France,
acting in the interests of Spain, who asked
upon what terms the President would consent
to peace.</p>

<p>Although American arms were everywhere
triumphant, and American fleets preparing
to invade the Mediterranean and ravage
the coasts of Spain itself, yet the President,
still consistent in his attitude&mdash;as desirous of
peace, yet determined to exact justice for the
oppressed&mdash;cordially welcomed the overtures
from Spain. In view of the overwhelming victories
of the United States, and the fact that
the country was but just beginning to draw
upon its vast resources, the provisions of the
preliminary protocol were liberal in the extreme.
These were, the independence of
Cuba, the cession of Puerto Rico and one of
the Ladrone Islands to the United States, and
the question of jurisdiction over the Philippines,
with other minor matters, to be left to
a joint commission. These terms were agreed
to by Spain on the 9th of August, and the
protocol for a treaty of peace was signed on
the 12th. Immediately upon the signing of
the protocol orders were sent to all United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
States military and naval commanders to
cease operations against the enemy at once.
The blockades of Cuban and Puerto Rican
ports were declared lifted; the war, in effect,
was ended.</p>

<p>The American soldiers were arrested in
mid-career of victory, with swords uplifted
and guns aimed at the enemy; nevertheless,
though many of them wept for very rage at
being baffled in their designs, they obeyed
implicitly the commands emanating from
Washington. In the far-off Philippines, however,
where brave Dewey and his sailors had
been for months awaiting the arrival of sufficient
re-enforcements to take and occupy
Manila, warlike preparations still continued.
On the day following the signing of the
protocol, and before the news had reached
the islands, the defences of Manila had been
assaulted and carried by our soldiers, the city
taken, together with more than seven thousand
prisoners, and the capital of the Philippines
became an American possession.
Owing to the difference in time between
Manila and Washington, the victory was assured
but a few hours after the negotiations
looking to peace had been concluded. As
there was no direct cable from Manila to the
United States, and despatches had to be sent
by vessel to and from Hong Kong, seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
hundred miles away, Admiral Dewey and
General Merritt, commanding respectively
the naval and land forces in the Philippines,
had acted without knowledge of the peace
proceedings, and thus fortuitously Manila
was taken before the war was officially ended.
This fact had an important bearing upon the
subsequent negotiations of the peace commissioners,
who were appointed later by the
Governments of Spain and the United States,
and met in Paris to arrange the final terms,
as by the fall of the capital of the Philippines
the whole group was virtually conquered.</p>

<p>The situation was complicated by the actions
of the Philippine insurgents under General
Aguinaldo, who were already in revolt
against Spain before the Spanish fleet was
destroyed by Dewey’s squadron. As in Cuba,
the natives of the Philippines had suffered
for centuries from Spanish oppressions, and
their condition of late years had been one of
chronic revolt; terrible atrocities had been
committed on both sides, and neither party
had given evidence of a capacity for government
or for advance in the paths of progress
and civilization. Upon the arrival of the
American fleet and army the insurgents had
made common cause with the United States;
but each side viewed the other with distrust.
The Spaniards, hemmed in between the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
forces of Aguinaldo and the fleet and soldiers
of the Americans, displayed great bravery in
a hopeless cause; but at the very last, convinced
of the futility of resistance, surrendered
to the latter. They distrusted the
insurgents, but put faith in the promises of
the Americans, which promises were kept to
the letter; and the transference of authority
from Spanish to American hands was accomplished
without disturbance.</p>

<p class="p2">The total duration of this war between
Spain and the United States was only one
hundred and fourteen days! Within that
brief period this country had raised and
equipped an army of two hundred thousand
men; established camps of detention and instruction
in various parts of the land; had
increased the navy by more than double its
number of vessels before the war; had provided
for a war loan of two hundred million
dollars (which was entirely taken by a patriotic
people); for a war revenue, which was
borne without a murmur; had blockaded the
ports of Cuba and Puerto Rico; had taken the
eastern provinces of the former and the western
of the latter; and yet the American giant
had but just begun to bestir himself when
the war was ended!</p>

<p>Still, it was no matter for boasting; for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
United States, with a population of more than
seventy millions, and its immense territory&mdash;even
though poorly equipped, with a small
navy and smaller army&mdash;was certain to prevail
in the end over Spain, with its population
of only eighteen millions, and two hundred
thousand miles of area. But again, at the
beginning there was not so great a disparity,
for the army of Spain on a peace footing
was one hundred and twenty thousand
men, and on a war footing half a million. Its
navy also (on paper) was superior to that of
the United States, and at the outset it was
supposed the latter would suffer most severely,
though ultimately it might win.</p>

<p>What, then, was the cause of Spain’s premature
discomfiture and utter collapse? Perhaps,
without arrogating to themselves any
superior virtues, the Americans may not be
mistaken in ascribing it to the corruption of
her body politic, to her pride, her refusal to
accept a lesson from experience. Above all,
she was fighting a forlorn hope; her cause
was foredoomed to failure, because it was
the cause of mediævalism, of the collective
cruelties of ages long agone; and the moral
sense of the world was against her. She
was reaping the harvest of retributory justice&mdash;the
field sown by Alva and Cortes,
by Pizarro and Philip II&mdash;yes, by Isabella<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the Catholic and Columbus! And what gall
of bitterness to the Spaniard, in the reflection
that the greatest nation in that hemisphere
brought to the knowledge of Europe
by Columbus, should be instrumental in
wresting from Spain the first among the
islands he discovered, and her last possessions
in America!</p>

<p>In justice to Spain, we should note that
she had seemed desirous of averting the war.
In response to President McKinley’s diplomatic
suggestions, through his minister at
Madrid, she pledged herself to inaugurate
reforms, recalled the cruel Weyler, and substituted
the pacific General Blanco; revoked
the edict which had proved the death-knell
of the <i>reconcentrados</i>, and proposed for Cuba
an autonomist government.</p>

<p>But all too late! She could not bring to
life the thousands of starved and murdered
Cubans, could not efface from the page of
history the record of her multitudinous cruelties.
It became necessary that the war should
be fought: that Spain should be punished for
her ignoring of the common rights of humanity,
her trampling upon the sacred brotherhood
of man.</p>

<p>With a queen regent whose court will
compare favourably for purity of morals with
any other in Europe, and a titular king yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
an innocent child; with public men like Castelar
and Sagasta devoted to reform; with
valorous soldiers and sailors blindly obedient,
and a common people adherent to the
monarchy: yet Spain’s system of government
is one of the most hideous relics of ancient
despotism.</p>

<p>And what can be expected or predicted of
a nation which, in its total population of
eighteen millions, contains at least twelve
million illiterate persons; in the Cortes of
which it was recently seriously proposed to
endow a school for bull-fighters; in which
cock-fighting and bull-fighting are the national
pastimes; where the successful bull-fighter
is the popular hero, and half a million
dollars are annually expended for bulls and
horses to be slaughtered in the arena; where
eight millions of the people have no trade or
profession, and there are nearly one hundred
thousand professional beggars; where,
though agriculture is the chief employment,
the land is broken up by means of wooden
ploughs; where, though rich in mineral resources,
the mines are farmed out to foreign
companies or their revenues hypothecated to
brokers abroad; and finally, where everything
taxable groans beneath its burden.</p>

<p>It is not inexplicable to the student of
history that Spain, with a formidable navy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
yet was rendered helpless in two engagements;
with more than one hundred thousand
soldiers in Cuba, yet surrendered after
but one city had been besieged and taken,
and whose vast colonial possessions fell to
pieces and crumbled like a house of cards.</p>

<p>Was it chance alone that chose Santiago
as the crucial battle ground&mdash;Santiago, where,
twenty-five years before, scores of American
sailors, men of the Virginius, were stood
against the white walls of a slaughter-house
and butchered in cold blood?</p>

<p>Was it chance alone that directed the
events of war so that the West Indies should
be the scene of final conflict&mdash;the Antilles,
which Spain had depopulated in the first century
of her rule, and made desert places of
fair isles which once supported millions of
innocent and happy inhabitants?</p>

<p>Was it strange that a nation guilty of such
enormities should lack the moral courage,
the sound heart and core of integrity, necessary
to withstand the impact of another nation
goaded by the spectacle of those iniquities
to righteous indignation?</p>

<p>While mourning the losses of the war,
with a heart still bleeding for their sons done
to death in battle and by disease&mdash;and they
were not few&mdash;the people of the United
States will never regret that they went forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
to fight for a principle. They have won the
commendation, they have compelled the respect,
of the world powers; yet more than
that: have given evidence of a moral and
physical virility which, it was feared, the past
generation of enervating peace had impaired.</p>

<p>“It is gratifying to all of us,” said President
McKinley, in a speech at a peace jubilee
in celebration of the cessation of hostilities,
“to know that this has never ceased to
be a war of humanity! The last ship that
went out of the harbour of Havana before
war was declared was an American ship
which had taken to the suffering people of
Cuba the supplies furnished by American
charity. And the first to sail into the harbour
of Santiago after the war ended was
another American ship bearing food supplies
to the starving Cubans. And I am sure it is
the universal prayer of American citizens
that justice and humanity and civilization
shall characterize the final settlement of
peace, as they have distinguished the progress
of the war.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<p class="pc2 mid">THE TREATY OF PEACE.</p>

<p class="p2">No better summary of the progress and
achievements of the war has been given than
in the words of the President, addressed to a
vast assemblage at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition,
in October, 1898:</p>

<p>“Our army had years ago been reduced
to a peace footing. We had only nineteen
thousand available troops when the war was
declared, but the account which officers and
men gave of themselves on the battlefields
has never been surpassed.</p>

<p>“The manhood was there and everywhere.
American patriotism was there, and its resources
were limitless. The courageous and
invincible spirit of the people proved glorious,
and those who a little more than a third
of a century ago were divided and at war
with each other, were again united under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
holy standard of liberty. Patriotism banished
party feeling; fifty millions of dollars
for the national defence was appropriated
without debate or division, as a matter of
course, and as only a mere indication of our
mighty reserve power.</p>

<p>“But if this is true of the beginning of
the war, what shall we say of it now, with
hostilities suspended and peace near at hand,
as we fervently hope? Matchless in its results!
Unequalled in its completeness and
the quick succession with which victory followed
victory! Attained earlier than it was
believed to be possible; so comprehensive in
its sweep that every thoughtful man feels
the weight of responsibility which has been
so suddenly thrust upon us. And, above all
and beyond all, the valour of the American
army, the bravery of the American navy, and
the majesty of the American name, stand
forth in unsullied glory, while the humanity
of our purposes and the magnanimity of our
conduct have given to war, always horrible,
touches of noble generosity, Christian sympathy
and charity, and examples of human
grandeur, which can never be lost to mankind.
Passion and bitterness formed no part of our
impelling motive, and it is gratifying to feel
that humanity triumphed at every step of the
war’s progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“The heroes of Manila and Santiago and
Puerto Rico made immortal history. They
are worthy successors and descendants of
Washington and Greene, of Paul Jones, Decatur,
and Hull, and of Grant, Sherman,
Sheridan, and Logan, of Farragut, Porter,
and Cushing, and of Lee, Jackson, and Longstreet.</p>

<p>“New names stand out on the honour roll
of the nation’s great men, and with them unnamed
stand the heroes of the trenches and
the forecastle, invincible in battle and uncomplaining
in death. The intelligent, loyal,
indomitable soldier and sailor and marine,
regular and volunteer, are entitled to equal
praise as having done their whole duty,
whether at home or under the baptism of
foreign fire. Who will dim the splendour of
their achievements? Who will withhold
from them their well-earned distinction?</p>

<p>“The faith of a Christian nation recognises
the hand of Almighty God in the ordeal
through which we have passed. Divine favour
seemed manifest everywhere. In fighting
for humanity’s sake we have been signally
blessed. We did not seek war. To
avoid it, if this could be done in justice and
honour to the rights of our neighbours and
ourselves, was our constant prayer. The
war was no more invited by us than were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the questions which are laid at our door by
its results. Now, as then, we will do our
duty. The problems will not be solved in a
day. Patience will be required&mdash;patience
combined with sincerity of purpose and unshaken
resolution to do right, seeking only
the highest good of the nation, and recognising
no other obligation, pursuing no other
path but that of duty.”</p>

<p>With the signing of the protocol hostilities
ceased, and by the middle of August, 1898,
the war had virtually ended. Each Government
appointed commissioners to arrange for
the evacuation of Cuba and Puerto Rico,
and by the 18th of October the latter island
was in exclusive possession of the United
States. Owing to the presence in Cuba of
so large a number of Spanish troops&mdash;more
than one hundred thousand&mdash;and the great
extent of that island, the evacuation proceedings
were more slowly carried out, and it was
not until the 1st of January, 1899, that Havana,
the capital, was delivered into the sole
care of the Americans.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, peace commissioners had been
appointed by each country, five by Spain and
five by the United States, who met in Paris
the first week in October. After long and
deliberate sessions, and not without some
friction from their divergent views, a treaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
of peace was concluded, which was signed by
all the commissioners on the 10th of December,
and presented to the Executive of the
United States the day before Christmas.</p>

<p>Although the United States occupied the
position of conqueror, and was in a situation
where it could exact its own terms,
still it did not presume upon its advantages,
and was exceedingly generous in its treatment
of the fallen foe. By the capture of
Manila, the capital of the Philippines, the
Americans had practically acquired possession
of that vast group in Asiatic waters.
Nevertheless, the United States agreed to
pay the Spaniards the sum of twenty million
dollars, and to repatriate all Spanish troops
then on service there.</p>

<p>By the terms of the protocol, confirmed
by the treaty, Puerto Rico and its adjacent
islands in the Atlantic were ceded to the victors
without reservation, and became American
property. In the East the island of Guam,
in the Ladrones, was ceded as a coaling station,
and the vast archipelagos of the Philippines
and Sulus. The island of Cuba, while
freed from Spanish tyranny, did not directly
become a possession of the United States, as
that Government had distinctly disclaimed
any intention of assuming sovereignty over
it except for its pacification only. “Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
rule,” declared President McKinley, in his message
to Congress of December 8, 1898, “must
be replaced by a just, benevolent, and humane
government, created by the people of Cuba,
capable of performing all international obligations,
and which shall encourage thrift, industry,
and prosperity, and promote peace and
goodwill among all the inhabitants, whatever
may have been their relations in the past.
Neither revenge nor passion should have a
place in the new government. Until there is
complete tranquility in the island, and a
stable government inaugurated, military occupation
will be continued.”</p>

<p>The complete transfer of authority was not
unaccompanied by disturbance, either in the
Philippines or in Cuba. In the former islands
the native insurgents, mistrusting the humane
intentions of their new masters, manifested a
spirit of turbulence which indicated that they
would have to be pacified before intrusted
with the full measure of freedom. In truth,
it would appear that the actual war was a
minor matter compared with the gigantic
task the United States had undertaken of
preparing the diverse peoples to walk in the
paths of progress and higher civilization.</p>

<p>In Cuba, filling the places made vacant
by the withdrawal of the Spanish soldiery,
the American army gradually possessed itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of every strategic point, and by the 1st
of January, 1899, the island was practically
held by the Americans. At noon of that day
the Spanish flag was hauled down and the
Stars and Stripes hoisted in its place, above
the historic Morro Castle, where the banner
of Spain had floated (except for a brief intermission)
for nearly three hundred years.
Captain-General Castellanos, who had succeeded
General Blanco in November, and
was then in command of the Spanish forces,
met the American commissioners at the palace
in Havana, and resigned his authority
over the island in the following words:</p>

<p>“According to the protocol of peace,
signed August 12th, I, obeying the orders of
the government of her Catholic Majesty, the
Queen-Regent of Spain, and in the name of
her son, his Majesty the King, deliver the
island of Cuba to the Government of the
United States, represented by your commission.”</p>

<p>General Wade, chief of the American
commissioners, made an equally brief reply,
and then gave this important trust into the
keeping of General Brooke, the military governor.</p>

<p>As General Castellanos left the palace for
the steamer on which he was to take his departure,
the American soldiers drawn up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the plaza presented arms, the officers saluted
with their swords, and the American
military band played the royal Spanish march.</p>

<p>This unfortunate Spanish official, to whom
had been intrusted the disagreeable duty of
relinquishing into foreign hands the supreme
authority over Cuba, was profoundly moved,
and, as he heard the salutes being fired in
honour of the American flag, which had now
supplanted the emblem of Spain, he said,
brokenly: “This is the most bitter moment
of my life. I pray that none of you will ever
suffer what I am suffering now.”</p>

<p>Thus he departed, carrying with him the
sympathy and esteem of those who but recently
had been his foes. The spirit of goodwill
and fraternal feeling was never more
manifest than between the Spaniards and
Americans in Cuba; for with the cessation
of strife disappeared all animosities of whatever
nature. Only the Cubans, who had been
prevented for important reasons from participating
in the final demonstrations attendant
upon the occupation of Havana, and who
allowed themselves to distrust the motives of
the conquerors, held aloof at first and seemed
to cherish revengeful feelings.</p>

<p>But when General Castellanos advanced
to General Menocal, a Cuban high in authority,
and said, “I am sorry, sir, that we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
been enemies, having the same blood in our
veins,” the latter answered generously: “Sir,
we fought for Cuba. Now that she is free,
we are no longer enemies!”</p>

<p>All animosities seemed then to be forgotten,
and it would appear that the United
States had already succeeded in its pacific
mission of intervention, as the air was rent
with the cries of “<i>Viva España!” “Viva
America!” “Viva Cuba Libre!</i>”</p>

<p>If a spirit of revenge had been cherished
by the Americans, it must needs have been
appeased that afternoon, at the sight of
American soldiers marching through the capital
city of Havana, with the former Consul-General
Fitzhugh Lee at their head, and in
the harbour the Stars and Stripes floating from
a spar above the sunken war ship Maine.</p>

<p>There seems every reason to believe that
the noble aspiration of the great American
Executive will be realized:</p>

<p>“As soon as we are in possession of Cuba,
and have pacified the island, it will be necessary
to give aid and direction to its people
to form a government for themselves. This
should be undertaken at the earliest moment
consistent with safety and assured success.
It is important that our relations with this
people shall be of the most friendly character,
and our commercial relations close and reciprocal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
It should be our duty to assist in
every proper way to build up the waste places
of the island, encourage the industry of the
people, and assist them to form a government
which shall be free and independent;
thus realizing the best aspirations of the
Cuban people.”</p>

<p>The city of Santiago is already a notable
object-lesson of the benefits of American rule,
where soldiers from the Cuban army and
impoverished <i>pacificos</i> have been generously
paid by the military governor to assist at the
work of reform.</p>

<p>America has shown that her declaration
of sympathy with suffering humanity in the
Spanish islands: in the Philippines as well as
in Cuba, were not idle words spoken for effect
upon the outside world, but the voicing
of a principle which has been consistently
adhered to, not only through the din of battle
but in the hush of peace. And not the
least of her victories is that over herself&mdash;second
only to that which has brought to her
side (compelled by admiration of her deeds
and inherent love for valorous performances)
the “motherland” of America: England,
home of the sea-kings, Drake and his colleagues
who assisted at the destruction of the
armada; Nelson, who buried Spanish prestige
in the watery grave of Trafalgar. International<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
comity advances to a higher plane,
international obligations acquire a new significance,
when nations are inspired by mutual
respect and regard.</p>

<p>At the opening of the nineteenth century
Spain’s sway extended over nearly one half
the total area of the three Americas, her possessions
in the western hemisphere being estimated
at 6,750,000 square miles. At its
close she held no territory here, and her flag
had disappeared from the isles and continents
discovered by Columbus and conquered
by her soldiers.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this century the United
States controlled less than a million
square miles of territory; at its ending, more
than 3,600,000! While it was once claimed
by Spain that on her vast empire the sun
never set; of the American possessions, since
the acquisition of the Philippines, it is literally
true.</p>

<p>This reversal of relative conditions at the
close of the century must be apparent even
to the Spanish nation, now contracted within
the ancient confines of the Iberian Peninsula,
shorn of prestige, glory, and colonies.</p>

<p>Paradoxical as it may seem, yet Spain’s
losses by war may eventually become her
gain; for her colonies had long been clogs
upon her progress, and had devoured her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
substance greedily. No longer compelled to
maintain a large standing army, or to send
abroad the flower of her young manhood,
Spain can devote to agriculture and manufactures,
to art and literature, the forces that
were worse than wasted in camp and on the
battlefield.</p>

<p>She has no worse enemies than those of
her own household; but still on her borders
rises the fateful apparition of Don Carlos the
pretender. In time, perhaps, if the lessons
of the war are heeded, the Spaniard may be
able to perceive the absurdity of that boastful
Spanish proverb, “Whoever says Spain,
says everything!”</p>
